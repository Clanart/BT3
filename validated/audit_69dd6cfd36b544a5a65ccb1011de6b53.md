## Analog Found: Stale in-memory `StakesCache` after partitioned epoch-reward distribution bypasses the cache-sync path

### Title
Partitioned epoch-reward stake writes bypass `StakesCache` synchronization, leaving `Bank::stakes_cache` stale relative to on-chain stake account state - (File: `runtime/src/bank/partitioned_epoch_rewards/distribution.rs`)

### Summary
The Sherlock report's root cause is a *dual-state consistency bug*: `Edition.setFeeStrategy()`/`publish()` update the canonical `works[tokenId].strategy` value but never call the sync routine (`_setTokenRoyalty`) that keeps the derived/cached ERC2981 royalty value coherent, so a reader of the cached value gets stale data. Agave has the structurally identical pattern between `Bank::stakes_cache` (an in-memory derived cache of stake delegations/vote-account stakes) and the stake accounts persisted to accounts-db.

### Finding Description
`Bank::stakes_cache` is only kept in sync with on-chain stake/vote account state through one designated sync path: `Bank::update_stakes_cache()`, which is invoked exclusively from normal transaction-execution post-processing: [1](#0-0) 

That function walks `sanitized_txs`/`processing_results` for touched accounts and calls `StakesCache::check_and_store()` for each one: [2](#0-1) 

`StakesCache::check_and_store()` is the only place that upserts/removes vote and stake delegations from the cache: [3](#0-2) 

However, partitioned epoch-reward distribution — a separate, non-transactional Bank state mutation that directly credits stake accounts with inflation/block rewards and rewrites their `Stake.delegation.stake` — writes the updated stake accounts straight to accounts-db via `self.store_accounts(...)`, without going through `update_stakes_cache()`/`check_and_store()`: [4](#0-3)  (the account mutation happens in `build_updated_stake_reward`, and the sole persistence call is `self.store_accounts(...)`)

The updated `Stake.delegation.stake` is computed and written into the account: [5](#0-4) 

but the corresponding `StakeAccount` entry inside `self.stakes_cache` (the `imbl::HashMap<Pubkey, StakeAccount>` used for `delegated_stakes`, `vote_accounts.get_delegated_stake`, and next-epoch activation math) is never refreshed by this code path — only `check_and_store()` recomputes `delegated_stakes`/`vote_accounts` stake totals via `upsert_stake_delegation`: [6](#0-5) 

This is exactly analogous to the reported bug: the canonical/source-of-truth value (`works[tokenId].strategy` / the on-chain stake account) is updated by a privileged, correct code path, but the derived cache that other consumers read (`ERC2981` internal royalty value / `Bank::stakes_cache`) is never told to resynchronize, because the update did not go through the one function (`_setTokenRoyalty` / `check_and_store`) responsible for that.

### Impact Explanation
`stakes_cache` (via `Stakes<StakeAccount>`) backs delegated-stake amounts used for `vote_accounts()` snapshots, `EpochStakes`, leader-schedule stake weighting, and `compute_new_epoch_caches_and_rewards`, which explicitly reads `self.stakes_cache.stakes()` to compute the next epoch's activated stake and vote-account distribution: [7](#0-6) 

If a stake account receives a reward but is not otherwise touched by a transaction before the next epoch boundary, `stakes_cache` will still report its pre-reward `delegation.stake`, understating that voter/staker's effective stake in any consumer that reads the cache directly (gossip stake weighting, RPC `getVoteAccounts`/`getStakeActivation`-style views backed by the bank cache, or vote-credit/tower stake-weight lookups) rather than re-reading accounts-db. This causes incoherent stake accounting between the persisted ledger state and the runtime's own cached view — the same "public getter vs. internal state desync" class as the ERC2981 report, but here affecting stake-weighted decisions that are foundational to consensus and gossip.

### Likelihood Explanation
Partitioned epoch rewards are distributed on every epoch boundary for every staked account, so this code path executes unconditionally and frequently (once per epoch, across many partitions/blocks) as shown in `distribute_partitioned_epoch_rewards`/`distribute_epoch_rewards_in_partition`: [8](#0-7) 

No malicious actor is required — this is triggered by ordinary reward distribution, matching the "unprivileged" scope of the task.

### Recommendation
After `store_stake_accounts_in_partition()` persists `updated_stake_rewards` via `store_accounts()`, explicitly call `self.stakes_cache.check_and_store(...)` (or an equivalent bulk-refresh routine) for each rewarded stake pubkey/account, mirroring what `update_stakes_cache()` does for transaction-driven mutations, so `stakes_cache` reflects the newly rewarded `delegation.stake` immediately rather than only on the next incidental transaction.

### Proof of Concept
Conceptual sequence (based on local code, not independently executed):
1. At an epoch boundary, `distribute_partitioned_epoch_rewards()` runs and calls `distribute_epoch_rewards_in_partition()` → `store_stake_accounts_in_partition()`.
2. `build_updated_stake_reward()` increases `new_stake.delegation.stake` and writes it into the account object [5](#0-4) .
3. The batch of updated accounts is persisted only via `self.store_accounts(...)` [9](#0-8) ; no call to `stakes_cache`/`check_and_store` occurs in this file.
4. Any code path reading `bank.stakes_cache.stakes()` for the affected stake pubkey before a subsequent ordinary transaction touches that account (e.g., `compute_new_epoch_caches_and_rewards` at the very next epoch boundary, or any external consumer relying on `stakes_cache`) observes the pre-reward `delegation.stake`, diverging from the value actually stored in accounts-db.

**Uncertainty / what I could not fully verify:** I could not, within the available tool budget, read the full body of `Bank::store_accounts`/`store_account` in `runtime/src/bank.rs` to rule out some indirect internal hook that resyncs `stakes_cache` as a side effect of that call. If such a hook exists, this finding would be invalidated or reduced to a documentation gap. I recommend a Devin session with full repo access to confirm the implementation of `Bank::store_accounts` and trace all downstream consumers of `stakes_cache` (especially outside `runtime/src/bank.rs`, e.g. in gossip/tower/RPC crates) before treating this as confirmed.
