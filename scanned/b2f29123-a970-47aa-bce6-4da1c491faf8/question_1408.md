# Q1408: debt-remove-scaled via borrow: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the future mask produced by the new debt bit reach `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) in a state where it satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? Given that it clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `borrow` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
