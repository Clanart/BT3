# Q5342: get-cached-indexes via call-ststx-ratio: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `call-ststx-ratio` twice with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched varied, and assert that the value `get-cached-indexes` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
