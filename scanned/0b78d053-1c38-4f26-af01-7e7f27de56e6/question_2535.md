# Q2535: add_root_and_flush_write_cache slot-removal liveness bug

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `add_root_and_flush_write_cache` by submit transactions that write many accounts near root transitions with many-account write bursts plus immediate root/read churn so that slot-removal logic can discard account data still needed by later state resolution, breaking the invariant that slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::add_root_and_flush_write_cache
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that write many accounts near root transitions
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts plus immediate root/read churn
- Exploit idea: target old/new slot overlap for the same pubkey
- Invariant to test: slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn one pubkey across removable and non-removable slots
