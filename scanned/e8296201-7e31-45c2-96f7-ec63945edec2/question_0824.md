# Q824: try_lock_accounts_with_results program-cache staleness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `try_lock_accounts_with_results` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with duplicated writable/read-only aliases, address lookup tables, and batched conflicting write sets such that upgrade, close, or deploy timing makes this function observe a stale executor or stale deployment slot state, breaking the invariant that program cache contents must match loader-visible deployment state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::try_lock_accounts_with_results
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: duplicated writable/read-only aliases, address lookup tables, and batched conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: look for old-code/new-state or new-code/old-state combinations
- Invariant to test: program cache contents must match loader-visible deployment state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race loader upgrades or closes against repeated invocations
