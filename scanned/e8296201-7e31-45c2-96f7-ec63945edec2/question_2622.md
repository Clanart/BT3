# Q2622: read_only_accounts_cache.load index inconsistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that repeatedly fetch recently changed accounts with rapid read-after-write patterns against the same accounts so that indexes or lookup tables updated around this function can disagree with the stored account payloads they point to, breaking the invariant that indexes must resolve to the exact account version later returned to rpc or runtime callers and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs::load
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that repeatedly fetch recently changed accounts
- Attacker controls: rapid read-after-write patterns against the same accounts
- Exploit idea: force same-pubkey and same-owner churn to look for torn index state
- Invariant to test: indexes must resolve to the exact account version later returned to RPC or runtime callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare indexed reads to direct storage reads during high-churn updates
