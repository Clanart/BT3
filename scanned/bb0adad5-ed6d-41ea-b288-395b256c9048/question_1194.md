# Q1194: receive-underlying via transfer: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, can an unprivileged attacker make `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `transfer` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury across its boundary values through `transfer` in simnet and assert `receive-underlying` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
