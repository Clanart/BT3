# Q919: Solana init_transfer_sol burn or lock before irreversible state via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Solana `init_transfer_sol` instruction` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_sol` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `burn or lock before irreversible state` under handles outbound native-SOL bridging while still posting the same class of Near-bound transfer payload, violating `native-SOL outbound flows must not emit claims whose amount or fee exceeds the value actually escrowing or burning on Solana`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_sol`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `init_transfer_sol` instruction`
- Attacker controls: payer lamports, recipient string, amount, fee, native fee, and message
- Exploit idea: Look for branches where custody changes happen before the final pending-state, mapping, or callback outcome is fixed. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: native-SOL outbound flows must not emit claims whose amount or fee exceeds the value actually escrowing or burning on Solana
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Model failures between custody changes and state writes, then assert that no branch both consumes user value and allows the transfer to be replayed or dropped. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
