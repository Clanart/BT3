# Q1452: total-assets via liquidate-redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `total-assets` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
