# Q1823: modify_memory_region_of_account sysvar snapshot drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `modify_memory_region_of_account` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with account layouts, duplicate writable aliases, realloc paths, and nested cpi writes such that clock, rent, blockhash, or slot-hash values observed here can drift relative to the state later committed, breaking the invariant that a transaction should observe one coherent sysvar snapshot for its admitted execution context and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/serialization.rs::modify_memory_region_of_account
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: account layouts, duplicate writable aliases, realloc paths, and nested CPI writes
- Exploit idea: search for split sysvar snapshots across one processing lifecycle
- Invariant to test: a transaction should observe one coherent sysvar snapshot for its admitted execution context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace sysvar values at admission, execution, and commit
