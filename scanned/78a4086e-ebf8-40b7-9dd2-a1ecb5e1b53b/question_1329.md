# Q1329: store_account_and_update_capitalization loaded-data undercount

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store_account_and_update_capitalization` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transactions that create, close, resize, or rewrite many accounts in one batch such that loaded-accounts-data accounting can be made smaller than the real memory footprint or persisted delta, breaking the invariant that loaded account data size must track real loaded and committed state accurately and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::store_account_and_update_capitalization
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transactions that create, close, resize, or rewrite many accounts in one batch
- Exploit idea: aim for account-resize and ALT-heavy transactions that undercount loaded state
- Invariant to test: loaded account data size must track real loaded and committed state accurately
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: compare loaded-accounts-data counters to actual touched and resized account bytes
