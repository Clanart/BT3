# Q4743: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol - _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool, under an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, exploit this through `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` to break the reconciliation between `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` and the invariant that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent, yielding High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Precondition: an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert.
- Invariant to test: an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`: constrain the setup so that an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, fuzz the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool), and assert after every call that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent.
