# Q0920: Airdrop2.claim - startVestingTime is the only gate and is compared twice

## Question
In rewards/Airdrop2.sol, claim() requires block.timestamp >= startVestingTime and _getClaimable independently returns zero below it, so the two checks must agree, and any change to startVestingTime retroactively rewrites every account's vested figure against their existing claimed counter. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)` while block.timestamp is one second after an interval boundary, and drive `vested computed in _getClaimable` out of agreement with `claimedAmount[account]` - breaking the invariant that a vesting origin must not be able to move under accounts that have already claimed against it - for Critical - Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/Airdrop2.sol -> `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)` (mechanism: startVestingTime is the only gate and is compared twice)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: totalAmount and merkleProof for any leaf that verifies against the root, plus isLock and the claim timing
- Exploit idea: claim() requires block.timestamp >= startVestingTime and _getClaimable independently returns zero below it, so the two checks must agree, and any change to startVestingTime retroactively rewrites every account's vested figure against their existing claimed counter. Precondition: block.timestamp is one second after an interval boundary.
- Invariant to test: a vesting origin must not be able to move under accounts that have already claimed against it; concretely, `vested computed in _getClaimable` must stay reconciled with `claimedAmount[account]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (totalAmount and merkleProof for any leaf that verifies against the root, plus isLock and the claim timing) under block.timestamp is one second after an interval boundary, asserting on every row that a vesting origin must not be able to move under accounts that have already claimed against it.
