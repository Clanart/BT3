# Q2934: ArbWomUp3.incentiveDeposit - the locked amount is taken from the whole contract balance

## Question
Consider wombat/ArbWomUp3.sol, where _deposit() mode 2 reads mWomBal = IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this)) after the convert and locks that entire balance for _account, so any mWOM stranded on the contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to this caller. Assuming the caller repeats the deposit from several addresses in one block, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `rewardToSend` and `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(address(this))` via `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _convertRatio, bool _bullMode, uint256 _mode)`, breaking the invariant that a caller must only be credited with the value their own transaction produced and producing Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/ArbWomUp3.sol -> `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _convertRatio, bool _bullMode, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: the locked amount is taken from the whole contract balance)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _convertRatio, bool _bullMode, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, _convertRatio, _bullMode and _mode, with _mode selecting stake, mWomSV lock or plain transfer
- Exploit idea: _deposit() mode 2 reads mWomBal = IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this)) after the convert and locks that entire balance for _account, so any mWOM stranded on the contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to this caller. Precondition: the caller repeats the deposit from several addresses in one block.
- Invariant to test: a caller must only be credited with the value their own transaction produced; concretely, `rewardToSend` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the caller repeats the deposit from several addresses in one block, snapshot `rewardToSend` and `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(address(this))`, run the attacker's `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _convertRatio, bool _bullMode, uint256 _mode)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
