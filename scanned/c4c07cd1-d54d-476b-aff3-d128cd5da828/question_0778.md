# Q778: Misbind storage-proof semantics in sync_citrea_txs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions so `sync_citrea_txs` treats one storage slot, value, or path as proving another, corrupting the light-client proof context tied to a specific Bitcoin block and violating the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/sync.rs::sync_citrea_txs
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions
- Exploit idea: treat one storage slot/value/path as if it proved another using replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
