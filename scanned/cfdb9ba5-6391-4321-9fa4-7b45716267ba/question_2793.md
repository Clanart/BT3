# Q2793: accounts_cache.add_root valid-input crash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `add_root` by submit transactions that touch many accounts near root advancement with many-account writes near root advancement so that validly encoded account/notification state or subscription flow can still reach a panic or abort, breaking the invariant that valid inputs and valid subscription flows must not crash this path and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::add_root
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that touch many accounts near root advancement
- Attacker controls: many-account writes near root advancement
- Exploit idea: treat state-filtering and watcher code as crash surfaces
- Invariant to test: valid inputs and valid subscription flows must not crash this path
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: fuzz only valid subscription parameters and event payload shapes while monitoring for crashes
