# Q2170: handle_forwarded_packets rollback dirty state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `handle_forwarded_packets` by submit transactions that legitimately enter the forwarding path with payload sizes, duplicate packets, versioned messages, and boundary forwarding timing such that a failing transaction can leave dirty cache, balance, or metadata state behind even though execution is reported as failed, breaking the invariant that failed transactions must not leak state changes into later execution or rpc views and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/fetch_stage.rs::handle_forwarded_packets
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that legitimately enter the forwarding path
- Attacker controls: payload sizes, duplicate packets, versioned messages, and boundary forwarding timing
- Exploit idea: search for post-failure state that survives into later reads or commits
- Invariant to test: failed transactions must not leak state changes into later execution or RPC views
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: force late failures after many writes and diff caches and post-state against a fresh bank reconstruction
