# Q1579: Solana DeployToken initialize_token_metadata decimal cap creates wrong economic model via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public deploy flow through `deploy_token`` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/deploy_token.rs::initialize_token_metadata` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `decimal cap creates wrong economic model` under hashes overlong token strings to derive mint seeds, caps decimals, writes Metaplex metadata, and posts a `DeployTokenResponse` back to Near, violating `mint-seed derivation, decimal capping, and metadata writes must produce one canonical wrapped token per signed remote asset`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/deploy_token.rs::initialize_token_metadata`
- Entrypoint: `public deploy flow through `deploy_token``
- Attacker controls: token string bytes, name, symbol, decimals, payer funding, and metadata PDA seeds
- Exploit idea: Target capped decimals on EVM, Solana, and Starknet deployments and later amount conversions during sign/finalize/claim flows. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: mint-seed derivation, decimal capping, and metadata writes must produce one canonical wrapped token per signed remote asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Deploy high-decimal assets and assert that every later amount conversion preserves one consistent economic relation to the source asset. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
