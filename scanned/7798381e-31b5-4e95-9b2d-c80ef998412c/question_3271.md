# Q3271: translate_account_infos confuses account types or owners (cpi.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `translate_account_infos` in `program-runtime/src/cpi.rs` with an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data, and have `translate_account_infos` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`translate_account_infos` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/cpi.rs` -> `translate_account_infos()` (around line 901)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `translate_account_infos` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `translate_account_infos` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `translate_account_infos` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy a program that reads or writes host/guest memory outside its permitted regions, or forges an account reference, and extracts or corrupts state belonging to other accounts.
