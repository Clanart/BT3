# Q0025: current_shopify_session_id: An `id_token` for shop A while `shop` param is shop B, testing ...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params) reach `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb via GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy, supplying an `id_token` for shop A while `shop` param is shop B, testing `reject_mismatched_requested_shopify_domain`, so that requested vs authenticated shop mismatch must block the request, not fall through on a blank value is violated, leading to cross-shop access using a valid token for a different store? Specifically confirm that concurrent execution produces exactly one consistent session/token with no cross-tenant leakage.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb — `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange`
- Entrypoint: GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params — specifically an `id_token` for shop A while `shop` param is shop B, testing `reject_mismatched_requested_shopify_domain`.
- Exploit idea: Fire the flow twice in parallel to expose non-atomic checks or double-writes.
- Invariant to test: requested vs authenticated shop mismatch must block the request, not fall through on a blank value
- Expected Immunefi impact: cross-shop access using a valid token for a different store (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: concurrency test running the flow on N threads and asserting exactly one row/token and no cross-tenant write.
