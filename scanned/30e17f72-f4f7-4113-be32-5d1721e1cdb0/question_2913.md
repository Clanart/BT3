# Q2913: NEAR storage_withdraw promise bookkeeping can be overwritten or orphaned through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public NEAR storage-management entrypoint` with control over withdraw amount, caller account, and timing relative to pending transfer lifecycle and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::storage_withdraw` from the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `promise bookkeeping can be overwritten or orphaned` attack class because subtracts from stored storage balance and transfers NEAR back to the caller, violating `withdrawals must not let users pull out storage still required for pending, finalised, or fast-transfer records that underpin live funds`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::storage_withdraw`
- Entrypoint: `public NEAR storage-management entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: withdraw amount, caller account, and timing relative to pending transfer lifecycle
- Exploit idea: Probe maps keyed only by account ids or derived storage accounts when multiple pending operations are possible. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: withdrawals must not let users pull out storage still required for pending, finalised, or fast-transfer records that underpin live funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Create overlapping deferred operations and assert that each one has independent bookkeeping and cleanup. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::storage_withdraw` and the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping after every branch.
