# Q2571: with_token_refetch: A 401 retry loop where `retrying` local is mis-scoped so infini...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `shopify_id_token` reused for the refetch) reach `with_token_refetch` in lib/shopify_app/admin_api/with_token_refetch.rb via an authenticated API call that receives a 401 and retries via token exchange, supplying a 401 retry loop where `retrying` local is mis-scoped so infinite retries or a stale token are used, so that the refetched token must belong to the same verified shop/user as the failing session is violated, leading to cross-shop token substitution during retry (token confusion)? Specifically confirm that a wrong-secret or tampered artifact is always rejected before any side effect.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/admin_api/with_token_refetch.rb — `with_token_refetch`
- Entrypoint: an authenticated API call that receives a 401 and retries via token exchange
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_id_token` reused for the refetch — specifically a 401 retry loop where `retrying` local is mis-scoped so infinite retries or a stale token are used.
- Exploit idea: Run the exact flow with a deliberately-wrong secret/signature/token to prove verification actually rejects it.
- Invariant to test: the refetched token must belong to the same verified shop/user as the failing session
- Expected Immunefi impact: cross-shop token substitution during retry (token confusion) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: negative-control test asserting a wrong-secret/wrong-signature/tampered-token request is rejected with no side effect.
