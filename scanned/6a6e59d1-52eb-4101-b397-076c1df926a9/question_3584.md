# Q3584: verify_request: A request ordering issue where `head(:unauthorized)` is set but...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the raw body and X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header) reach `verify_request` in app/controllers/shopify_app/extension_verification_controller.rb via POST to any controller subclassing ExtensionVerificationController, supplying a request ordering issue where `head(:unauthorized)` is set but execution continues (note the head-before-log ordering), so that extension requests must be rejected before any action body runs when HMAC is invalid is violated, leading to forged extension request accepted (auth bypass)? Specifically confirm that merchant A can never load, write, or act with merchant B's session, token, or scopes.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/extension_verification_controller.rb — `verify_request`
- Entrypoint: POST to any controller subclassing ExtensionVerificationController
- Attacker controls: the raw body and X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header — specifically a request ordering issue where `head(:unauthorized)` is set but execution continues (note the head-before-log ordering).
- Exploit idea: Perform the flow as merchant A while naming shop/user B and confirm no B-scoped data is reachable.
- Invariant to test: extension requests must be rejected before any action body runs when HMAC is invalid
- Expected Immunefi impact: forged extension request accepted (auth bypass) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: two-tenant integration test asserting A's request never loads, writes, or acts with B's session/token.
