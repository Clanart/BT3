# Q0493: find-and-resolve-asset-value via collateral-add: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `find-and-resolve-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668) — which reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found — to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, breaking the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668` -> `find-and-resolve-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `find-and-resolve-asset-value` reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found. Reach it through `collateral-add` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `find-and-resolve-asset-value` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
