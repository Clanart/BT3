# Q2572: NEAR near_withdraw_callback custody accounting diverges from wrapped supply at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `callback after unwrapping wNEAR during public payouts` with boundary-controlled inputs covering zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::near_withdraw_callback` violate `unwrap callbacks must not create a state where finalization succeeded but the native payout can be replayed, redirected, or permanently stranded` in the `custody accounting diverges from wrapped supply` attack class because sends raw NEAR to the recipient only after the wrapped-token withdrawal promise succeeds becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::near_withdraw_callback`
- Entrypoint: `callback after unwrapping wNEAR during public payouts`
- Attacker controls: recipient account, amount, and success/failure of the preceding wNEAR withdrawal
- Exploit idea: Target branches that mint, burn, lock, unlock, transfer vault assets, or unwrap native value. Concentrate on zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values.
- Invariant to test: unwrap callbacks must not create a state where finalization succeeded but the native payout can be replayed, redirected, or permanently stranded
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Build a per-asset conservation model and assert that total claims never exceed total backing after every public flow. Sweep boundary values for zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
