# Q1688: NEAR remove_fast_transfer storage quote underestimates live state through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `internal helper reached from public callbacks and fee claims` with control over fast-transfer id, storage owner, and timing relative to claim or refund and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::remove_fast_transfer` from the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `storage quote underestimates live state` attack class because removes stored fast-transfer state and refunds reserved storage balance to the recorded storage owner, violating `removal must not refund the wrong payer or reopen a fast transfer that can still influence claim, payout, or lock accounting`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::remove_fast_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `internal helper reached from public callbacks and fee claims`
- Attacker controls: fast-transfer id, storage owner, and timing relative to claim or refund
- Exploit idea: Target helper functions that quote storage for pending transfers, finalization records, fast transfers, binds, or deployments. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: removal must not refund the wrong payer or reopen a fast transfer that can still influence claim, payout, or lock accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Measure storage usage across maximal inputs and assert that quoted requirements always exceed or equal the true post-state footprint. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::remove_fast_transfer` and the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping after every branch.
