# Q2696: accounts_cache.store zero-lamport resurrection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store` by submit transactions that update many accounts in one slot with many writable accounts, repeated same-pubkey writes, and slot-boundary churn so that dead or zero-lamport accounts can survive or reappear because cleanup and load paths disagree, breaking the invariant that closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::store
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that update many accounts in one slot
- Attacker controls: many writable accounts, repeated same-pubkey writes, and slot-boundary churn
- Exploit idea: look for stale dead-account visibility after close/recreate churn
- Invariant to test: closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: close and recreate the same attacker-controlled account shape repeatedly
