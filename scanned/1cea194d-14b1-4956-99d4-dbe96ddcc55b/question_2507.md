# Q2507: create_account premature frozen-slot assumption

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `create_account` by submit transactions that rapidly create, fund, close, and recreate accounts with rapid create-close-recreate cycles and near-boundary account sizes so that this path can treat a slot as finalized for one purpose before all related account state is safely written, breaking the invariant that frozen-slot assumptions must not outpace actual durable state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::create_account
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that rapidly create, fund, close, and recreate accounts
- Attacker controls: rapid create-close-recreate cycles and near-boundary account sizes
- Exploit idea: search for early frozen assumptions
- Invariant to test: frozen-slot assumptions must not outpace actual durable state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace slot-freeze transitions and storage durability
