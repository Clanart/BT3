# Q0729: current_shopify_session_id: A token whose `dest` host is a look-alike accepted by `jwt_shop...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params) reach `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb via GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy, supplying a token whose `dest` host is a look-alike accepted by `jwt_shopify_domain` -> `sanitize_shop_domain`, so that requested vs authenticated shop mismatch must block the request, not fall through on a blank value is violated, leading to cross-shop access using a valid token for a different store? Specifically confirm that the malicious input stays rejected across refactors (pinned fixture).

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb — `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange`
- Entrypoint: GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params — specifically a token whose `dest` host is a look-alike accepted by `jwt_shopify_domain` -> `sanitize_shop_domain`.
- Exploit idea: Encode the exact malicious input as a fixture so a future refactor can't silently reopen the hole.
- Invariant to test: requested vs authenticated shop mismatch must block the request, not fall through on a blank value
- Expected Immunefi impact: cross-shop access using a valid token for a different store (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: regression fixture pinning the malicious input to a rejected outcome for CI.
