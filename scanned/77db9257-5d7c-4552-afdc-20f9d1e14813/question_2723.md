# Q2723: Confuse confirmation/finalization tracking in set_cancel_txid_seen_at_height

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit timing around the `rbf_signing_info` object so `set_cancel_txid_seen_at_height` records a confirmation/finalization view that diverges from the actual chain state, corrupting the finalized/seen-at-height status recorded for the send request and breaking the invariant that RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent, leading to Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/db/tx_sender.rs::set_cancel_txid_seen_at_height
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `rbf_signing_info` object
- Exploit idea: diverge chain-observation state from persisted send state using the `rbf_signing_info` object
- Invariant to test: RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
