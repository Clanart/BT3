# Q2663: Accept wrong proof/network context in create_reveal_script

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges through user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync so `create_reveal_script` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the storage slot/value pair used to prove deposit or withdrawal state and breaking the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/reveal_scripts.rs::create_reveal_script
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
