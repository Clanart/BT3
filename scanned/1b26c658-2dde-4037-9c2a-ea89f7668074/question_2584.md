# Q2584: Duplicate queue or processing state in prove_block_headers_genesis

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `prove_block_headers_genesis` twice with attacker-controlled Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and violating the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/header_chain_prover.rs::prove_block_headers_genesis
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
