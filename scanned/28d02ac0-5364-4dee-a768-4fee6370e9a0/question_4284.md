# Q4284: resolve-pyth via call-ststx-ratio: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block reach `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `resolve-pyth` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
