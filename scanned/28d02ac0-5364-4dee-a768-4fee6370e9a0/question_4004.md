# Q4004: interpolate-rate via accrue: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update reach `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it interpolates between packed u16 curve points, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `accrue` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update varied, and assert that the value `interpolate-rate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
