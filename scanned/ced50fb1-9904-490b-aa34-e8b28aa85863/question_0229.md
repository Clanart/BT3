# Q0229: iter-lookup-collateral via borrow: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `amount`, drive `iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) — which skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `borrow` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with `amount`, then read `iter-lookup-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
