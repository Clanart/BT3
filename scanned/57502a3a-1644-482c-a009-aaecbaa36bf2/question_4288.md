# Q4288: total-debt via liquidate-redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
