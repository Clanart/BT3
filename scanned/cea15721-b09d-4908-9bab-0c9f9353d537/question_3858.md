# Q3858: NEAR deploy_token entry fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `deploy_token` proof-submission flow` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical` under verifies a metadata proof and forwards the attached deposit into `deploy_token_callback` to deploy a wrapped or native bridge token on Near, violating `one remote asset and one metadata event must map to one canonical token deployment with coherent decimals and storage accounting`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token`
- Entrypoint: `public `deploy_token` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and timing relative to other token deployments
- Exploit idea: Target checks that only inspect mint authority, owner, or one mapping row without proving the full asset identity. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: one remote asset and one metadata event must map to one canonical token deployment with coherent decimals and storage accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Construct plausible fake bridge-controlled assets and assert that deployment, settlement, and forwarding reject them unless they are the canonical mapping for that remote asset. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
