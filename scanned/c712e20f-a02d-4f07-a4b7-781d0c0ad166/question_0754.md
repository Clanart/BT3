# Q0754: SmartWomConvert.smartConvert - safeApprove without reset on the router leg

## Question
In wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol, _convertFor() calls IERC20(wom).safeApprove(router, buybackAmount) with no prior zeroing, so router allowance residue permanently disables the buyback leg and, through _sendRewards, the harvest path. Starting from a state where the attacker has pushed mWom below buybackThreshold against wom in the same transaction, can an unprivileged EOA use `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` to leave `obtainedmWomAmount` inconsistent with `IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this))`, violating the invariant that an approval on a repeated path must be idempotent and extracting High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol -> `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset on the router leg)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountIn and _mode, plus the pool state that currentRatio and maxSwapAmount are read from
- Exploit idea: _convertFor() calls IERC20(wom).safeApprove(router, buybackAmount) with no prior zeroing, so router allowance residue permanently disables the buyback leg and, through _sendRewards, the harvest path. Precondition: the attacker has pushed mWom below buybackThreshold against wom in the same transaction.
- Invariant to test: an approval on a repeated path must be idempotent; concretely, `obtainedmWomAmount` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the attacker has pushed mWom below buybackThreshold against wom in the same transaction, have the attacker run `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `obtainedmWomAmount` versus `IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this))` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
