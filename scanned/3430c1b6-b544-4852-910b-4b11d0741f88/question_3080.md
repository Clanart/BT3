# Q3080: NewEVMSigPreVerifier - Set Code Transaction Signature Is Checked With A Stale Signer

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit, replace, reorder, or batch pending transactions through `raw transaction submitted to app mempool preverification` while controlling `pending nonce` and `replacement tx`, under the precondition that strict nonce ordering is enforced by CometBFT mempool, drive `broadcastTx fallback -> CometBFT BroadcastTx -> FinalizeBlock ante` in `appmempool/preverify.go::NewEVMSigPreVerifier` so that set-code transaction signature is checked with a stale signer, violating the invariant that replacement and strict nonce rules must not create double execution, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `appmempool/preverify.go::NewEVMSigPreVerifier`
- Entrypoint: `raw transaction submitted to app mempool preverification`
- Attacker controls: `pending nonce`, `replacement tx`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: set-code transaction signature is checked with a stale signer through `broadcastTx fallback -> CometBFT BroadcastTx -> FinalizeBlock ante`.
- Invariant to test: replacement and strict nonce rules must not create double execution.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: force the edge value at uint64/uint256/sdk.Int boundaries and assert no smaller debit, larger refund, or supply change occurs.
