# Q0292: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.depositLP - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol - WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _lpAmount, under the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, exploit this through `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` to break the reconciliation between `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` and `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` and the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding, yielding High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, have the attacker run `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` versus `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
