# Q3098: EVM Wormhole initTransferExtension same fee collectible twice at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public outbound flow through `initTransfer` on Wormhole-backed chains` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::initTransferExtension` violate `outbound message publication must remain one-to-one with consumed assets and must not diverge under underpayment, overpayment, or callback/retry edge cases` in the `same fee collectible twice` attack class because serializes a Wormhole `InitTransfer` payload and publishes it using the current nonce and supplied value becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::initTransferExtension`
- Entrypoint: `public outbound flow through `initTransfer` on Wormhole-backed chains`
- Attacker controls: msg.value passed as `value`, current `wormholeNonce`, sender, token address, origin nonce, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, and message
- Exploit idea: Target pending-transfer cleanup, fast-transfer removal, and replay protection around fee-claim proofs. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: outbound message publication must remain one-to-one with consumed assets and must not diverge under underpayment, overpayment, or callback/retry edge cases
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Claim once, then replay or mutate non-economic proof fields and assert that no second claim succeeds or blocks unrelated transfers. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
