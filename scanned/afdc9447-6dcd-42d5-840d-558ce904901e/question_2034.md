# Q2034: Confuse replacement linkage in add_script_path_to_witness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests so `add_script_path_to_witness` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the deposit-to-move-tx binding to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/actor.rs::add_script_path_to_witness
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
