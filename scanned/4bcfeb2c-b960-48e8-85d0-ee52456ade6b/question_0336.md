# Q336: NEAR message publication and later proof consumption coupling stored state versus signed bytes mismatch via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public init/finalize/deploy/log flows across every chain adapter` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `README-supported Wormhole, EVM light-client, and MPC-backed flows across repo` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `stored state versus signed bytes mismatch` under the bridge publishes source events on one chain and later consumes proofs or signatures of those events on another chain using chain-specific adapters, violating `publication and consumption must remain one-to-one across all supported chains so a valid event on one domain cannot be replayed or misparsed as another domain’s event`?

## Target
- File/function: `README-supported Wormhole, EVM light-client, and MPC-backed flows across repo`
- Entrypoint: `public init/finalize/deploy/log flows across every chain adapter`
- Attacker controls: proof/message bytes, chain selection, and any supported chain among Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, BNB, Solana, Starknet, Bitcoin, and Zcash
- Exploit idea: Look for canonical-state versus emitted-bytes drift on optional strings, decimals, origin ids, or fee recipients. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: publication and consumption must remain one-to-one across all supported chains so a valid event on one domain cannot be replayed or misparsed as another domain’s event
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Compare persisted transfer records to their signed or published payloads and assert byte-for-byte equivalence of all economically-relevant fields. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
