# Q4599: insert via supply-collateral-add: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `insert` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
