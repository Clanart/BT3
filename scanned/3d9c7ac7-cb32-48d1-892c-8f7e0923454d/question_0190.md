# Q0190: relevant via repay: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `repay` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
