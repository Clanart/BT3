# Q2095: resolve via collateral-add: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
`resolve` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360) selects the efficiency group for a position mask. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, use that to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, violating the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360` -> `resolve`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `resolve` selects the efficiency group for a position mask. Reach it through `collateral-add` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, then read `resolve` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
