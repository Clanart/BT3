# Q1834: Leave reusable partial state in kickoff

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker force a partial failure around the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context and then resume public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `kickoff` continues from stale intermediate state, causing the emergency-stop transaction that should protect the same deposit to diverge from the canonical bridge context and breaking the invariant that partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/states/kickoff.rs::kickoff
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure around the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context and then resume under changed state
- Invariant to test: partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
