# Q4597: check-confidence via collateral-remove: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, drive `check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) — which compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent — to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the `price-feeds` buffers, then read `check-confidence` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
