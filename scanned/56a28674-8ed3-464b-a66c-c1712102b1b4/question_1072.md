# Q1072: check-confidence via call-ststx-ratio: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched reach `check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) in a state where it satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? Given that it compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
