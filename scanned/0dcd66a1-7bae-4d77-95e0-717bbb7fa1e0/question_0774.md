# Q0774: get-available-assets via deposit: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `deposit` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `get-available-assets` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
