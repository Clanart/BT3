# Q623: Keeper.ApplyTransaction - Leftover Gas Refund Uses Original Ctx While Execution Used Cache Ctx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call a malicious contract from an unprivileged EOA through `FinalizeBlock execution of MsgEthereumTx` while controlling `value` and `EIP-7702 authorization list`, under the precondition that a post-processing hook is configured in production and can fail, drive `ApplyTransaction -> ApplyMessageWithConfig -> PostTxProcessing -> RefundGas -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas` in `x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go::Keeper.ApplyTransaction` so that leftover gas refund uses original ctx while execution used cache ctx, violating the invariant that nonce, contract address, logs, bloom, receipts, and gas must match go-ethereum semantics, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go::Keeper.ApplyTransaction`
- Entrypoint: `FinalizeBlock execution of MsgEthereumTx`
- Attacker controls: `value`, `EIP-7702 authorization list`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: leftover gas refund uses original ctx while execution used cache ctx through `ApplyTransaction -> ApplyMessageWithConfig -> PostTxProcessing -> RefundGas -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas`.
- Invariant to test: nonce, contract address, logs, bloom, receipts, and gas must match go-ethereum semantics.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: replay the same scenario through eth_call or estimateGas and through eth_sendRawTransaction and assert the only difference is persistence.
