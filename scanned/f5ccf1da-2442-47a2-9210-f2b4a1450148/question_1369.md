# Q1369: load_program capitalization drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_program` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with program deployment/upgrade timing, cpi invocation patterns, and versioned message layouts such that lamport deltas can leave capitalization counters inconsistent with the actual account set, breaking the invariant that global capitalization must equal the sum of committed account balances and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::load_program
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: program deployment/upgrade timing, CPI invocation patterns, and versioned message layouts
- Exploit idea: make failed or partial writes skew aggregate lamport accounting
- Invariant to test: global capitalization must equal the sum of committed account balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: compare capitalization counters to reconstructed account sums after late-failing multi-write transactions
