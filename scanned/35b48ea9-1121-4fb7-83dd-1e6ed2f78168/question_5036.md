# Q5036: WombatPoolHelper.harvest - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Under an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, is there an unprivileged sequence of `harvest()` that leaves `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` unreconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, violates the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding, and delivers High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the exact block at which the pool's rewards are harvested and fee-split
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, then assert `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` end identical in both runs.
