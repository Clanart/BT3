# Q3783: total-assets-preview via redeem: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing `amount` of shares burned, use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `redeem` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-assets-preview` touches, run `redeem` with `amount` of shares burned, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
