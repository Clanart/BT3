# Q4750: total-debt via deposit: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `deposit` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
