# Q1573: prepare_next_cpi_instruction artifact memory blowup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `prepare_next_cpi_instruction` by submit transactions that perform cpi with instruction ordering, signer seeds, duplicated account metas, writable/read-only aliasing, and nested cpi depth such that logs, return data, inner instructions, or side-channel artifacts created downstream scale much faster than request size, breaking the invariant that execution artifact growth must stay bounded per transaction and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs::prepare_next_cpi_instruction
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that perform CPI
- Attacker controls: instruction ordering, signer seeds, duplicated account metas, writable/read-only aliasing, and nested CPI depth
- Exploit idea: use legal execution artifacts as the amplifier instead of raw packet size
- Invariant to test: execution artifact growth must stay bounded per transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: run the same heavy transaction repeatedly and correlate artifact size with resident memory
