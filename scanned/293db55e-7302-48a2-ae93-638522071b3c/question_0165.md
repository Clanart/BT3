# Q165: ConvertCoinNativeERC20 false success transfer

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through call a public ERC20/werc20 precompile method or submit `MsgConvertCoin` / `MsgConvertERC20` and use amount sizing including boundary values; receiver identity and address form; sender identity and call indirection; token amount, denom/contract address, receiver, sender, allowance state, callback timing, and calldata so that `x/erc20/keeper/msg_server.go:ConvertCoinNativeERC20` mishandles representation conversion settlement because `ConvertCoinNativeERC20` may trust return data, missing return data, or event patterns in a way that lets token movement appear successful even when backing state was not safely updated, causing `the success/failure result interpreted by the module` and `the actual balance movement on-chain` to diverge or settle in the wrong order, breaking the invariant that token movement must be committed and verified against final balance deltas, not only return-data shape or event presence and leading to `Theft / unauthorized extraction of funds`?

## Target
- File/function: `x/erc20/keeper/msg_server.go:ConvertCoinNativeERC20`
- Entrypoint: call a public ERC20/werc20 precompile method or submit `MsgConvertCoin` / `MsgConvertERC20`
- Attacker controls: amount sizing including boundary values; receiver identity and address form; sender identity and call indirection; token amount, denom/contract address, receiver, sender, allowance state, callback timing, and calldata
- Exploit idea: Drive the ERC20 / token-pair conversion path through a crafted path that reaches `ConvertCoinNativeERC20` with attacker-controlled amount sizing including boundary values; receiver identity and address form; sender identity and call indirection; token amount, denom/contract address, receiver, sender, allowance state, callback timing, and calldata. Then force the failure, replay, nested-call, or ordering condition described above and compare `the success/failure result interpreted by the module` against `the actual balance movement on-chain`.
- Invariant to test: token movement must be committed and verified against final balance deltas, not only return-data shape or event presence
- Expected Immunefi impact: `Theft / unauthorized extraction of funds`
- Fast validation: use malicious or edge-case ERC20 behavior in a test harness and verify the module rejects any path where expected balances do not actually move
