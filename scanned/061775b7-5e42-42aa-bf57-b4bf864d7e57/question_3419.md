# Q3419: add-user-collateral via repay: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `repay` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
