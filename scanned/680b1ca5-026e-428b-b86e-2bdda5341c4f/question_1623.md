# Q1623: Exploit witness/annex edge cases in fetch_new_blocks

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit witness, annex, or script-path edge cases in Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents so `fetch_new_blocks` verifies a different Bitcoin statement than later settlement relies on, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and violating the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/bitcoin_syncer.rs::fetch_new_blocks
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Exploit idea: make verification hash a different Bitcoin statement than settlement later uses via Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
