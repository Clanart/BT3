# Q1904: calc-principal-ratio-reduction via collateral-remove-redeem: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem reach `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191` -> `calc-principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem varied, and assert that the value `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
