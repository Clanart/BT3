# Q1245: collect_balances retry duplication

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `collect_balances` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transactions that resize accounts, trigger cpi, and partially fail after touching many balances such that queueing or retry logic can make one transaction execute or be charged more than once, breaking the invariant that one transaction submission should have one canonical execution lifecycle and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::collect_balances
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transactions that resize accounts, trigger CPI, and partially fail after touching many balances
- Exploit idea: focus on queue identity and retry lifecycle, not only the runtime core
- Invariant to test: one transaction submission should have one canonical execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: trace queue entries and executed signatures for retry-friendly transaction shapes
