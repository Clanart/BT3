# Q1808: PublicAPI.SendRawTransaction - Api Wrapper Forwarding Malformed Rlp Into Backend

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a signed raw Ethereum transaction through `public JSON-RPC eth_sendRawTransaction` while controlling `V/R/S signature values` and `chainId`, under the precondition that the sender has just enough EVM-denom balance for fee plus value, drive `RPC policy check -> Cosmos wrapping -> VerifyEthSig -> VerifyFee -> DeductTxCostsFromUserBalance` in `rpc/namespaces/ethereum/eth/api.go::PublicAPI.SendRawTransaction` so that API wrapper forwarding malformed RLP into backend, violating the invariant that only a transaction signed for the Cronos chain ID can commit, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/namespaces/ethereum/eth/api.go::PublicAPI.SendRawTransaction`
- Entrypoint: `public JSON-RPC eth_sendRawTransaction`
- Attacker controls: `V/R/S signature values`, `chainId`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: API wrapper forwarding malformed RLP into backend through `RPC policy check -> Cosmos wrapping -> VerifyEthSig -> VerifyFee -> DeductTxCostsFromUserBalance`.
- Invariant to test: only a transaction signed for the Cronos chain ID can commit.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: construct a contract harness that performs nested CALL/CREATE/SELFDESTRUCT/revert and compare bank keeper balances with StateDB balances.
