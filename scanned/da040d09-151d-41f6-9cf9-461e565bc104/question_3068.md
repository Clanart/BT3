# Q3068: eq derive a different canonical hash via AGG SIG ME and AGG SIG UNSAFE condition mixes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker feed a malicious CLVM spend output into condition parsing targeting `eq` in `crates/chia-consensus/src/conditions.rs` with AGG_SIG_ME and AGG_SIG_UNSAFE condition mixes with default-enabled consensus flags make chia_rs derive a different canonical hash, violating the invariant that only spend conditions satisfying consensus rules are accepted, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Consensus-valid spend, block generator, proof, or block record path can mint, burn, steal, double-spend, or mis-account Chia coins/rewards/fees?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-consensus/src/conditions.rs:771` / `eq`
- Entrypoint: feed a malicious CLVM spend output into condition parsing
- Attacker controls: AGG_SIG_ME and AGG_SIG_UNSAFE condition mixes
- Exploit idea: Drive `eq` through its public caller path using AGG_SIG_ME and AGG_SIG_UNSAFE condition mixes; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: only spend conditions satisfying consensus rules are accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Consensus-valid spend, block generator, proof, or block record path can mint, burn, steal, double-spend, or mis-account Chia coins/rewards/fees
- Fast validation: round-trip through py_validate_clvm_and_signature and Rust validation and compare results.
