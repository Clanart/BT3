# Q3361: convert-to-shares-preview via accrue: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, drive `convert-to-shares-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308) — which returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit — to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308` -> `convert-to-shares-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-shares-preview` returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Reach it through `accrue` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `accrue` with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, then read `convert-to-shares-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
