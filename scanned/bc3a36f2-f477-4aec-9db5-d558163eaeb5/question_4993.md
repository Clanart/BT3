# Q4993: debt-preview via collateral-remove-redeem: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `receiver` for the underlying leg, drive `debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) — which computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with `receiver` for the underlying leg, then read `debt-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
