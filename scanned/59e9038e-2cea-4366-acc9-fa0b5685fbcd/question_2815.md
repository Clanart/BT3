# Q2815: is_blockhash_valid is not deterministic across nodes (blockhash_query.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `is_blockhash_valid` in `rpc-client-nonce-utils/src/blockhash_query.rs` with an element set that hashes order-dependently when it should be order-independent, and make the bank snapshot a subscription captured disagree with the bank that later serves the notification, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `is_blockhash_valid` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc-client-nonce-utils/src/blockhash_query.rs` -> `is_blockhash_valid()` (around line 40)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: an element set that hashes order-dependently when it should be order-independent
- Exploit idea: Find input to `is_blockhash_valid` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `is_blockhash_valid` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `is_blockhash_valid` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy or upgrade a program, or poison the program cache, so honest validators execute different bytecode or produce different results for the same instruction.
