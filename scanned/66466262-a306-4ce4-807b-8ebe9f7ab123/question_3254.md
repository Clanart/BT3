# Q3254: resize confuses account types or owners (transaction_accounts.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `resize` in `transaction-context/src/transaction_accounts.rs` with the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices, and have `resize` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`resize` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-context/src/transaction_accounts.rs` -> `resize()` (around line 105)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: the same account passed twice in the account list under different indices
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `resize` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `resize` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `resize` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy a program that reads or writes host/guest memory outside its permitted regions, or forges an account reference, and extracts or corrupts state belonging to other accounts.
