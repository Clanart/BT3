# Q2509: create_account roots-to-flush backlog blowup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `create_account` by submit transactions that rapidly create, fund, close, and recreate accounts with rapid create-close-recreate cycles and near-boundary account sizes so that attacker-driven write patterns can keep the pending-root backlog large enough to destabilize memory or latency, breaking the invariant that pending roots and flush backlog must stay bounded under valid user workload and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::create_account
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that rapidly create, fund, close, and recreate accounts
- Attacker controls: rapid create-close-recreate cycles and near-boundary account sizes
- Exploit idea: treat backlog growth as the exploit
- Invariant to test: pending roots and flush backlog must stay bounded under valid user workload
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: drive repeated write bursts across roots and monitor backlog size
