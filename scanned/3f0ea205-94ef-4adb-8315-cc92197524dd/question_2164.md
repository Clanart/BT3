# Q2164: Substitute a wrong proof path into apply_block_headers

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker substitute part of attacker-controlled multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context so `apply_block_headers` accepts a proof, header, or path that should have been rejected, corrupting the kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove context treated as canonical for a deposit and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/header_chain/mod.rs::apply_block_headers
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: swap part of attacker-controlled multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context while keeping the rest seemingly valid
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
