# Q1572: Solana finalize_transfer delivery callback leaves inconsistent state via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Solana `finalize_transfer` instruction` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::finalize_transfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `delivery callback leaves inconsistent state` under verifies the NEAR-derived signature, uses `UsedNonces::use_nonce`, then either transfers from the native vault or mints bridged supply and posts a completion message back to Near, violating `a signed inbound transfer must settle exactly once to one mint/recipient pair and must not switch between native-vault and bridged-mint branches`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::finalize_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `finalize_transfer` instruction`
- Attacker controls: signed payload bytes, destination nonce, mint account, recipient account, vault existence, payer funding, and account ordering
- Exploit idea: Focus on `ft_transfer_call`, unwrap callbacks, and post-delivery resolution that decide whether to burn, refund, or remove records. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: a signed inbound transfer must settle exactly once to one mint/recipient pair and must not switch between native-vault and bridged-mint branches
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Enumerate callback results and assert that each result maps to exactly one consistent combination of delivered value, replay state, and storage refund. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
