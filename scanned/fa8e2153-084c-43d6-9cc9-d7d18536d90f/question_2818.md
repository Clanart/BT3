# Q2818: Starknet init_transfer native versus wrapped branch switch via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Starknet outbound transfer entrypoint` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::init_transfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `native versus wrapped branch switch` under checks pause flags, increments the origin nonce, burns bridge tokens when required, and emits an `InitTransfer` event using a normalized token address, violating `one outbound Starknet transfer must consume the exact caller-held asset that the event later authorizes on destination chains`?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::init_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet outbound transfer entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: token address, amount, fee, native fee, recipient `ByteArray`, message `ByteArray`, and caller
- Exploit idea: Target zero-address, deployed-token, custom-minter, native-vault, or bridge-token branch predicates. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: one outbound Starknet transfer must consume the exact caller-held asset that the event later authorizes on destination chains
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each branch predicate to flip around callbacks or mapping writes and assert that the same source asset can never produce two incompatible custody models. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
