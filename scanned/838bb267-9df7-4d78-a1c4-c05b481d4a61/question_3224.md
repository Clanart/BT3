# Q3224: SmartWomConvert.convertFor - shared mWOM balance is settled to whoever calls next

## Question
In wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol, mode 1 and mode 2 approve and forward obtainedmWomAmount out of the contract's own balance rather than out of a per-user ledger, so mWOM stranded in this contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to the next caller. Does `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the call arrives from ManualCompound.compound with a caller-supplied _convertRatio and _minRec and _mode two, so that `obtainedmWomAmount` diverges from `IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this))`, the invariant that one caller must never be settled out of value another caller left behind is broken, and the result is Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol -> `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: shared mWOM balance is settled to whoever calls next)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _for, _convertRatio, _minRec and _mode, reachable directly and through ManualCompound.compound
- Exploit idea: mode 1 and mode 2 approve and forward obtainedmWomAmount out of the contract's own balance rather than out of a per-user ledger, so mWOM stranded in this contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to the next caller. Precondition: the call arrives from ManualCompound.compound with a caller-supplied _convertRatio and _minRec and _mode two.
- Invariant to test: one caller must never be settled out of value another caller left behind; concretely, `obtainedmWomAmount` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the call arrives from ManualCompound.compound with a caller-supplied _convertRatio and _minRec and _mode two, have the attacker run `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `obtainedmWomAmount` versus `IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this))` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
