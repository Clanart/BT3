# Q3382: Solana InitTransfer::process optional string alias changes bridge subject via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public outbound flow through `init_transfer`` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/init_transfer.rs::process` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `optional string alias changes bridge subject` under routes an outbound transfer through native-vault custody or bridged-burn semantics and posts the serialized message to Wormhole/Near, violating `the posted payload must remain exactly backed by the consumed token or SOL value regardless of which branch executes`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/init_transfer.rs::process`
- Entrypoint: `public outbound flow through `init_transfer``
- Attacker controls: mint/vault branch choice, user signer, token account contents, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, and message
- Exploit idea: Focus on optional fee recipients, empty messages, token strings, and recipient strings. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: the posted payload must remain exactly backed by the consumed token or SOL value regardless of which branch executes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Cross-parse edge-case strings across all implementations and assert a single canonical meaning for every accepted value. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
