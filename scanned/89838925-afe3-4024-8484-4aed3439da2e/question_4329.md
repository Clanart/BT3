# Q4329: SmartWomConvert.smartConvert - shared mWOM balance is settled to whoever calls next

## Question
wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol: mode 1 and mode 2 approve and forward obtainedmWomAmount out of the contract's own balance rather than out of a per-user ledger, so mWOM stranded in this contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to the next caller. Under a residual mWOM balance from an earlier rounding sits in the contract, is there an unprivileged sequence of `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` that leaves `maxSwapAmount()` unreconciled with `IAsset(womAsset).cash() and IAsset(womAsset).liability()`, violates the invariant that one caller must never be settled out of value another caller left behind, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol -> `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: shared mWOM balance is settled to whoever calls next)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountIn and _mode, plus the pool state that currentRatio and maxSwapAmount are read from
- Exploit idea: mode 1 and mode 2 approve and forward obtainedmWomAmount out of the contract's own balance rather than out of a per-user ledger, so mWOM stranded in this contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to the next caller. Precondition: a residual mWOM balance from an earlier rounding sits in the contract.
- Invariant to test: one caller must never be settled out of value another caller left behind; concretely, `maxSwapAmount()` must stay reconciled with `IAsset(womAsset).cash() and IAsset(womAsset).liability()`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amountIn and _mode, plus the pool state that currentRatio and maxSwapAmount are read from) under a residual mWOM balance from an earlier rounding sits in the contract, asserting on every row that one caller must never be settled out of value another caller left behind.
