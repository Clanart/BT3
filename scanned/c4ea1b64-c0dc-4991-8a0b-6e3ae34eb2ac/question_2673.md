# Q2673: remove size-accounting drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads during account churn with read-after-delete and recreate patterns against the same accounts so that byte counters or cache-size accounting can undercount real resident or persisted account state, breaking the invariant that cache and storage size accounting must track actual resident state accurately and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs::remove
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads during account churn
- Attacker controls: read-after-delete and recreate patterns against the same accounts
- Exploit idea: use large-account churn to separate logical counts from physical bytes
- Invariant to test: cache and storage size accounting must track actual resident state accurately
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: measure counter growth against real resident bytes
