# Q3636: sanitize_requested_heap_size grows memory without an enforced bound (compute_budget_instruction_details.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `sanitize_requested_heap_size` in `compute-budget-instruction/src/compute_budget_instruction_details.rs` with a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length, and grow the buffer `sanitize_requested_heap_size` feeds without any eviction bound taking effect, so that the invariant "Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `compute-budget-instruction/src/compute_budget_instruction_details.rs` -> `sanitize_requested_heap_size()` (around line 192)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length
- Exploit idea: Repeatedly drive `sanitize_requested_heap_size` so a buffer, map, or cache it feeds grows without eviction, exhausting node memory below the cost the attacker pays.
- Invariant to test: Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Stress the path and assert the container's size plateaus rather than growing linearly with attacker input.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can perform syscall, CPI, memory-mapping, or deserialization work whose real CPU/memory cost far exceeds the compute units charged, degrading nodes below true cost.
