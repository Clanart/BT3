# Q4090: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getRewards - totalStaked and balanceOf drawn from unrelated sources

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, totalStaked() reads IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply() while balanceOf() reads MasterMagpie's UserInfo.amount for the same account, so the numerator and the denominator of every reward computation come from two independently maintained ledgers. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` while the attacker locks one block before a known large settlement and unlocks one block after, and drive `totalStaked()` out of agreement with `IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply()` - breaking the invariant that sum of balanceOf over all accounts must equal totalStaked at all times - for Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: totalStaked and balanceOf drawn from unrelated sources)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: totalStaked() reads IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply() while balanceOf() reads MasterMagpie's UserInfo.amount for the same account, so the numerator and the denominator of every reward computation come from two independently maintained ledgers. Precondition: the attacker locks one block before a known large settlement and unlocks one block after.
- Invariant to test: sum of balanceOf over all accounts must equal totalStaked at all times; concretely, `totalStaked()` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply()`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the attacker locks one block before a known large settlement and unlocks one block after, snapshot `totalStaked()` and `IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply()`, run the attacker's `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
