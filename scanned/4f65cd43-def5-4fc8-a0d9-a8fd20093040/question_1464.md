# Q1464: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.withdraw - withdraw releases the underlying before the stake check runs

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol - withdraw() calls IWombatStaking(wombatStaking).withdraw first, which sends the deposit token to msg.sender, and only afterwards calls _unstake, which is the step that actually verifies the caller had that much staked in MasterMagpie. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check, under the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, exploit this through `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` to break the reconciliation between `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` and the invariant that an entitlement must be verified before the value backing it leaves the protocol, yielding Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: withdraw releases the underlying before the stake check runs)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check
- Exploit idea: withdraw() calls IWombatStaking(wombatStaking).withdraw first, which sends the deposit token to msg.sender, and only afterwards calls _unstake, which is the step that actually verifies the caller had that much staked in MasterMagpie. Precondition: the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested.
- Invariant to test: an entitlement must be verified before the value backing it leaves the protocol; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, then assert `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` end identical in both runs.
