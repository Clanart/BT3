# Q4241: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.depositNative - safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie

## Question
In wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` while the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, and drive `this.balance(msg.sender)` out of agreement with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` - breaking the invariant that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent - for High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Precondition: the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body.
- Invariant to test: an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, then assert `this.balance(msg.sender)` and `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` end identical in both runs.
