# Q3626: subset via collateral-remove-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `subset` tests bitmask containment, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) varied, and assert that the value `subset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
