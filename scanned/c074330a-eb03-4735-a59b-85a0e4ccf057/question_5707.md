# Q5707: WombatPoolHelper.depositLP - V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` while MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, and drive `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` out of agreement with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` - breaking the invariant that the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal - for Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller
- Exploit idea: WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Precondition: MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed.
- Invariant to test: the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` sequence atomically under MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, asserting at the end that `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` still equals `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
