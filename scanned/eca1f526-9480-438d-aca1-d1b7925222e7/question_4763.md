# Q4763: mWOMSVBaseRewarder.getRewards - _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer credits value with no matching balance

## Question
In rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol, _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer() raises historicalRewards and rewardPerTokenStored without any token transfer, relying on the forfeited amount already sitting in the contract, so any path that reaches it without a real retained balance promises tokens the pool does not hold. Starting from a state where a registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer, can an unprivileged EOA use `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` to leave `_calExpireForfeit(account,_amount)` inconsistent with `mWOMSV.getRewardablePercentWAD(account)`, violating the invariant that the reward index may only be raised against tokens the contract has actually retained and extracting Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer credits value with no matching balance)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer() raises historicalRewards and rewardPerTokenStored without any token transfer, relying on the forfeited amount already sitting in the contract, so any path that reaches it without a real retained balance promises tokens the pool does not hold. Precondition: a registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer.
- Invariant to test: the reward index may only be raised against tokens the contract has actually retained; concretely, `_calExpireForfeit(account,_amount)` must stay reconciled with `mWOMSV.getRewardablePercentWAD(account)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish a registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer, have the attacker run `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_calExpireForfeit(account,_amount)` versus `mWOMSV.getRewardablePercentWAD(account)` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
