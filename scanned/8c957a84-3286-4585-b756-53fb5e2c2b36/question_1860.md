# Q1860: NEAR EVM prover verify_proof partial EVM validation leaves exploitable gap at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public EVM proof verifier entrypoint` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-prover/evm-prover/src/lib.rs::verify_proof` violate `the verifier must accept only receipts from the canonical safe chain and only for the exact log entry encoded in the proof` in the `partial EVM validation leaves exploitable gap` attack class because decodes RLP header, receipt, and log entry, checks the log against the receipt, verifies inclusion in the receipts trie, and then asks the light client for the safe block hash becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-prover/evm-prover/src/lib.rs::verify_proof`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM proof verifier entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: serialized `EvmVerifyProofArgs`, log index, receipt index, header, receipt, and trie proof nodes
- Exploit idea: Probe inconsistencies between receipt inclusion, log selection, event decoding, and block-hash validation. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: the verifier must accept only receipts from the canonical safe chain and only for the exact log entry encoded in the proof
- Expected Immunefi impact: Light client verification bypass
- Fast validation: Mutate one proof component at a time and assert that no accepted proof can change any economically-relevant decoded field after inclusion succeeds. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
