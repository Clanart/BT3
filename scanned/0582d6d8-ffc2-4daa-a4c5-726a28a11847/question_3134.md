# Q3134: filter_account_result roots-to-flush backlog blowup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_account_result` by use in-scope account subscriptions and hot account churn with account subscription filters, encodings, and hot account streams so that attacker-driven write patterns can keep the pending-root backlog large enough to destabilize memory or latency, breaking the invariant that pending roots and flush backlog must stay bounded under valid user workload and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_account_result
- Entrypoint: use in-scope account subscriptions and hot account churn
- Attacker controls: account subscription filters, encodings, and hot account streams
- Exploit idea: treat backlog growth as the exploit
- Invariant to test: pending roots and flush backlog must stay bounded under valid user workload
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: drive repeated write bursts across roots and monitor backlog size
