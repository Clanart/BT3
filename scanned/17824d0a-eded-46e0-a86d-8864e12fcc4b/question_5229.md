# Q5229: price-resolve via supply-collateral-add: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, drive `price-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:373) — which resolves a feed, applies the callcode transform, then checks `oracle-price-legal` and `oracle-timestamp-fresh` on the POST-transform value while advancing the per-key `last-update` only when the new timestamp is greater — to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, breaking the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:373` -> `price-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `price-resolve` resolves a feed, applies the callcode transform, then checks `oracle-price-legal` and `oracle-timestamp-fresh` on the POST-transform value while advancing the per-key `last-update` only when the new timestamp is greater. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `price-resolve` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
