# Q4280: vault-system-repay via borrow: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let reach `vault-system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207) in a state where it satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? Given that it routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207` -> `vault-system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-repay` routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `borrow` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let varied, and assert that the value `vault-system-repay` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
