# Q2587: EVM transfer payload Borsh encoding final settlement and later fee claim can diverge at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public EVM `finTransfer` and `deployToken` signature paths` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol signed payload assembly` violate `manual payload assembly must not admit alternative byte layouts that verify the same signature for materially different bridge actions` in the `final settlement and later fee claim can diverge` attack class because manually concatenates payload fields before Keccak and ECDSA recovery becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol signed payload assembly`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM `finTransfer` and `deployToken` signature paths`
- Attacker controls: all fields concatenated into Borsh-encoded bytes including optional fee-recipient and message bytes
- Exploit idea: Target differences between settle-time denormalization and claim-time recomputation of fee, dust, or relayer substitution. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: manual payload assembly must not admit alternative byte layouts that verify the same signature for materially different bridge actions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Compare settled principal, stored transfer record, and fee-claim proof under edge amounts and assert that the three always reconstruct one consistent event. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
