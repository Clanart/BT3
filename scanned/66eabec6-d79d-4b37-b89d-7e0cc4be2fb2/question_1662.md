# Q1662: NEAR init_transfer resume path storage payer or owner spoofing through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `yield-resume callback for a previously deferred outbound transfer` with control over timing of storage funding, promise completion order, storage owner, message-storage account state, and the original transfer message contents and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_resume` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `storage payer or owner spoofing` attack class because removes a stored promise id, retries storage transfer from the message account, and then restarts `init_transfer_internal` after a timeout or callback result, violating `resume logic must never let one deferred transfer be funded, resumed, or emitted more than once or under a different payer/value pairing`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_resume`
- Entrypoint: `yield-resume callback for a previously deferred outbound transfer`
- Attacker controls: timing of storage funding, promise completion order, storage owner, message-storage account state, and the original transfer message contents
- Exploit idea: Exploit signer/predecessor splits, message-storage account ids, or promise bookkeeping to shift storage liabilities between accounts. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: resume logic must never let one deferred transfer be funded, resumed, or emitted more than once or under a different payer/value pairing
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Simulate conflicting `sender_id`, `signer_id`, and pre-funded storage accounts and assert that only the intended payer can fund, resume, or recover that transfer. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_resume` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
