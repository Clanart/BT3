# Q2011: Confuse replacement linkage in signed_txs_to_txid

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering so `signed_txs_to_txid` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the emergency-stop transaction that should protect the same deposit to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/builder/transaction/creator.rs::signed_txs_to_txid
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
