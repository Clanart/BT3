# Q981: load_execute_and_commit_transactions ALT account explosion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_execute_and_commit_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with versioned messages, alt-heavy account sets, cpi depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets such that address lookup tables make this function handle a much larger effective account surface than the early admission logic prices, breaking the invariant that versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::load_execute_and_commit_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, ALT-heavy account sets, CPI depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: use legal ALT expansion to amplify load, lock, or verification work
- Invariant to test: versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: benchmark identical logic with and without ALT expansion
