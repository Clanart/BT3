# Q2416: flush_accounts_cache result-cloning chain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `flush_accounts_cache` by submit transactions that touch many writable accounts and then query them immediately with many-account write bursts, slot churn, and immediate read-after-write rpcs so that large notification objects are cloned more than necessary, breaking the invariant that notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::flush_accounts_cache
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that touch many writable accounts and then query them immediately
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts, slot churn, and immediate read-after-write RPCs
- Exploit idea: look for repeated clones of the same large object
- Invariant to test: notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: profile allocations and clone counts while delivering large notifications
