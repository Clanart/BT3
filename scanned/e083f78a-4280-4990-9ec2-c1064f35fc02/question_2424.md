# Q2424: remove_unrooted_slots cleanup drops live state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove_unrooted_slots` by submit transactions across fast fork churn and then query recent state with many-account write bursts, slot churn, and recent-state queries so that cleanup or compaction can discard still-live attacker-controlled account state, breaking the invariant that live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::remove_unrooted_slots
- Entrypoint: submit transactions across fast fork churn and then query recent state
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts, slot churn, and recent-state queries
- Exploit idea: look for mistaken liveness decisions under fast churn
- Invariant to test: live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn many attacker-owned accounts through close/recreate/update cycles
