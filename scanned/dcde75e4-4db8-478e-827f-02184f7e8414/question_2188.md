# Q2188: serialize_os_kzg_commitment_info serialization ambiguity in output.cairo (mode/version split)

## Question
Can a malicious user transaction set shaping storage writes, messages, class declarations, and block-level state diffs use message payloads, message ordering, message-triggered calldata, the shape of the resulting state diff through crafted valid transactions to make `serialize_os_kzg_commitment_info` in `crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/output.cairo` serialize attacker-shaped state, calldata, messages, or hashes in two distinct ways that downstream consumers can parse as the same logical object or vice versa around L1/L2 message uniqueness and accounting, so that honest StarkNet OS execution commits, emits, or accepts an attacker-favorable result that reaches direct loss of funds? Can validate/execute mode, deprecated/new code paths, or output-mode switches make honest executions disagree on the same public input?

## Target
- File/function: crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/output.cairo:202 :: serialize_os_kzg_commitment_info
- Entrypoint: malicious user transaction set shaping storage writes, messages, class declarations, and block-level state diffs
- Attacker controls: message payloads, message ordering, message-triggered calldata, the shape of the resulting state diff through crafted valid transactions
- Exploit idea: exploit a non-canonical length, packing, relocation, or versioning boundary in the serialized output while this function is handling L1/L2 message uniqueness and accounting. Exploit a mode, version, or output-format split so one phase authorizes a behavior that another phase commits differently.
- Invariant to test: every serialized StarkNet OS artifact must have one canonical encoding that hashes, relocates, and replays identically across honest consumers All supported modes and versions must preserve one canonical authorization and commitment result for the same accepted public input.
- Expected bounty impact: Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: fuzz lengths, empty segments, packed/full flags, and relocation boundaries around this function, then assert round-trip parsing produces exactly one interpretation Cross-test the old/new or validate/execute variants with the same public input and assert they cannot commit divergent results.
