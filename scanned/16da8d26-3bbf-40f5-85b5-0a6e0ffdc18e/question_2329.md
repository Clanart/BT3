# Q2329: servicer capitalization drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `servicer` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one client with packet layouts, signature counts, versioned messages, and duplicate-account transaction shapes such that lamport deltas can leave capitalization counters inconsistent with the actual account set, breaking the invariant that global capitalization must equal the sum of committed account balances and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/sigverify_stage.rs::servicer
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one client
- Attacker controls: packet layouts, signature counts, versioned messages, and duplicate-account transaction shapes
- Exploit idea: make failed or partial writes skew aggregate lamport accounting
- Invariant to test: global capitalization must equal the sum of committed account balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: compare capitalization counters to reconstructed account sums after late-failing multi-write transactions
