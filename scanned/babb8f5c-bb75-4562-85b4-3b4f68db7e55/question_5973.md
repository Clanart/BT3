# Q5973: mask-to-list-internal via collateral-add: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, drive `mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) — which expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `collateral-add` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `mask-to-list-internal` touches, run `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
