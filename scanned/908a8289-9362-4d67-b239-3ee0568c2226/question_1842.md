# Q1842: BribeRewardPool.stakeFor - scaling factor taken from an unrelated staking token

## Question
In rewards/BribeRewardPool.sol, the inherited _provisionReward scales by 10**stakingTokenDecimals, where stakingToken was fixed at construction and is unrelated to the vlMGP-denominated vote balances this pool actually tracks. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `stakeFor(address _for, uint256 _amount) via WombatBribeManager.vote` while the bribe token registered for this gauge charges a transfer fee, and drive `_balances[account]` out of agreement with `totalSupply` - breaking the invariant that the scaling factor must match the unit the balance ledger is denominated in - for Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BribeRewardPool.sol -> `stakeFor(address _for, uint256 _amount) via WombatBribeManager.vote` (mechanism: scaling factor taken from an unrelated staking token)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `stakeFor(address _for, uint256 _amount) via WombatBribeManager.vote`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the delta and the beneficiary, both chosen by the voter calling vote
- Exploit idea: the inherited _provisionReward scales by 10**stakingTokenDecimals, where stakingToken was fixed at construction and is unrelated to the vlMGP-denominated vote balances this pool actually tracks. Precondition: the bribe token registered for this gauge charges a transfer fee.
- Invariant to test: the scaling factor must match the unit the balance ledger is denominated in; concretely, `_balances[account]` must stay reconciled with `totalSupply`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the bribe token registered for this gauge charges a transfer fee, then assert `_balances[account]` and `totalSupply` end identical in both runs.
