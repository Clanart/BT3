# Q2816: roots_to_flush result-cloning chain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `roots_to_flush` by submit transactions that keep many roots dirty while reading hot accounts with heavy write churn across nearby roots plus immediate reads so that large notification objects are cloned more than necessary, breaking the invariant that notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::roots_to_flush
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that keep many roots dirty while reading hot accounts
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn across nearby roots plus immediate reads
- Exploit idea: look for repeated clones of the same large object
- Invariant to test: notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: profile allocations and clone counts while delivering large notifications
