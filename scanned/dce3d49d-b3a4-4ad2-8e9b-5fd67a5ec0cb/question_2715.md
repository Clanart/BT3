# Q2715: accounts_cache.store hot-stream starvation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store` by submit transactions that update many accounts in one slot with many writable accounts, repeated same-pubkey writes, and slot-boundary churn so that one hot account/program/signature stream monopolizes work and starves other subscribers, breaking the invariant that one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::store
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that update many accounts in one slot
- Attacker controls: many writable accounts, repeated same-pubkey writes, and slot-boundary churn
- Exploit idea: measure cross-subscriber fairness
- Invariant to test: one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: pair a hot stream with a cheap control subscription
