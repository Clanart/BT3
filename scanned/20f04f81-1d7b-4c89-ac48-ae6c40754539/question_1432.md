# Q1432: Leave reusable partial state in perform_deposit

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker force a partial failure around the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` and then resume public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `perform_deposit` continues from stale intermediate state, causing the deposit-to-move-tx binding to diverge from the canonical bridge context and breaking the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/rpc/aggregator.rs::perform_deposit
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure around the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` and then resume under changed state
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
