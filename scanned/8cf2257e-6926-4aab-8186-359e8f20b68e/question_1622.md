# Q1622: Solana metadata-seed derivation hashed or padded seed collision via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `deploy_token`` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/deploy_token.rs metadata PDA creation` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `hashed or padded seed collision` under creates metadata for a newly deployed wrapped mint using a hashed-or-padded token string as the core remote identity, violating `seed derivation must not let long token ids, collisions, or PDA reuse create a second remote asset that aliases an existing mint or metadata account`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/deploy_token.rs metadata PDA creation`
- Entrypoint: `public `deploy_token``
- Attacker controls: mint PDA, metadata PDA seeds, payer funding, and extremely long token strings that get hashed before seed use
- Exploit idea: Target hashed token strings, low-half salts, and deterministic-address truncation. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: seed derivation must not let long token ids, collisions, or PDA reuse create a second remote asset that aliases an existing mint or metadata account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Search the seed space for collisions and assert that every derivation function preserves uniqueness of remote asset identity. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
