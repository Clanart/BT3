# Q0012: calc-liq-factor-bound via liquidate-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `calc-liq-factor-bound` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718) in a state where it satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? Given that it scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718` -> `calc-liq-factor-bound`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-bound` scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the borrower targeted across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-liq-factor-bound` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
