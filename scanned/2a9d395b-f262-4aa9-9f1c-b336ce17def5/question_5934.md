# Q5934: find via collateral-remove: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the set of assets held, can an unprivileged attacker make `find` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `find` resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135` -> `find`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `find` resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the set of assets held across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `find` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
