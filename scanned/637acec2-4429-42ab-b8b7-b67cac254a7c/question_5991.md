# Q5991: unpack-u16 via accrue: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `accrue` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `unpack-u16` touches, run `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
