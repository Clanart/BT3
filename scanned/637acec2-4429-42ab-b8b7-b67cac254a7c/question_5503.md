# Q5503: get-asset-value via collateral-remove: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
`get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the set of assets held, use that to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, then read `get-asset-value` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
