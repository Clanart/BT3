# Q0530: callback: A callback whose `state` does not match the OAuth cookie, probi...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`code`, `shop`, `state`, `host`, `hmac`, `timestamp` and the OAuth cookie) reach `callback / validated_auth_objects` in app/controllers/shopify_app/callback_controller.rb via GET /auth/shopify/callback (public OAuth redirect target), supplying a callback whose `state` does not match the OAuth cookie, probing CSRF/state binding in validate_auth_callback, so that the session may be stored only for the shop cryptographically bound by the validated OAuth callback is violated, leading to account takeover via OAuth code/shop confusion (token theft)? Specifically confirm that no protected state is reachable by skipping or repeating an auth step.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/callback_controller.rb — `callback / validated_auth_objects`
- Entrypoint: GET /auth/shopify/callback (public OAuth redirect target)
- Attacker controls: `code`, `shop`, `state`, `host`, `hmac`, `timestamp` and the OAuth cookie — specifically a callback whose `state` does not match the OAuth cookie, probing CSRF/state binding in validate_auth_callback.
- Exploit idea: Walk the auth state machine out of order (skip/repeat a step) and confirm no step can be reached unauthenticated.
- Invariant to test: the session may be stored only for the shop cryptographically bound by the validated OAuth callback
- Expected Immunefi impact: account takeover via OAuth code/shop confusion (token theft) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: state-machine test exercising out-of-order transitions and asserting each protected state still requires verification.
