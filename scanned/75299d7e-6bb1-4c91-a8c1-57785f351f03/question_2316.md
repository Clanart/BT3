# Q2316: from clvm skip a required validation guard via CLVM atoms with redundant sign bytes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker serialize typed values back into CLVM targeting `from_clvm` in `crates/clvm-derive/src/from_clvm.rs` with CLVM atoms with redundant sign bytes at a fork-height or boundary-value activation point make chia_rs skip a required validation guard, violating the invariant that CLVM atom encodings have canonical typed meanings, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-derive/src/from_clvm.rs:11` / `from_clvm`
- Entrypoint: serialize typed values back into CLVM
- Attacker controls: CLVM atoms with redundant sign bytes
- Exploit idea: Drive `from_clvm` through its public caller path using CLVM atoms with redundant sign bytes; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: CLVM atom encodings have canonical typed meanings
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption
- Fast validation: fuzz CLVM atoms and lists and assert typed decoding matches clvmr semantics.
