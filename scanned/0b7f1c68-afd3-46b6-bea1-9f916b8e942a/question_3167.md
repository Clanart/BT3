# Q3167: NEAR public proof-kind multiplexing optional-field encoding ambiguity at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public proof-submission entrypoints` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fin_transfer/claim_fee/deploy_token/bind_token using shared verifier outputs` violate `one validated proof must not be reusable across public bridge entrypoints whose economic effects differ, even if they share the same outer verifier contract` in the `optional-field encoding ambiguity` attack class because multiple public bridge entrypoints trust the same verifier envelope and then downcast to different `ProverResult` variants becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fin_transfer/claim_fee/deploy_token/bind_token using shared verifier outputs`
- Entrypoint: `public proof-submission entrypoints`
- Attacker controls: proof kind, source chain, and bytes that a prover returns as `ProverResult`
- Exploit idea: Focus on empty strings, optional fee recipients, and zero-length messages that are encoded specially. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: one validated proof must not be reusable across public bridge entrypoints whose economic effects differ, even if they share the same outer verifier contract
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Generate payloads that differ only by optional-field encoding and assert that they cannot verify under the same proof while producing different bridge behavior. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
