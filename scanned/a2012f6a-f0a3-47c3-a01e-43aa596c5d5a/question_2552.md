# Q2552: NEAR normalized amount helpers final settlement and later fee claim can diverge at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public sign/finalize/claim paths across heterogeneous decimals` with boundary-controlled inputs covering decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::normalize_amount/denormalize_amount` violate `amount conversions must never misprice a user’s principal or fee by more than the documented dust behavior or let attackers move the rounding remainder to the wrong party` in the `final settlement and later fee claim can diverge` attack class because normalizes and denormalizes bridge amounts when crossing chains with different decimals and later uses those values for settlement and fee claim becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::normalize_amount/denormalize_amount`
- Entrypoint: `public sign/finalize/claim paths across heterogeneous decimals`
- Attacker controls: amount, fee, token decimals, origin decimals, destination decimals, and zero-fee versus nonzero-fee branches
- Exploit idea: Target differences between settle-time denormalization and claim-time recomputation of fee, dust, or relayer substitution. Concentrate on decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges.
- Invariant to test: amount conversions must never misprice a user’s principal or fee by more than the documented dust behavior or let attackers move the rounding remainder to the wrong party
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Compare settled principal, stored transfer record, and fee-claim proof under edge amounts and assert that the three always reconstruct one consistent event. Sweep boundary values for decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
