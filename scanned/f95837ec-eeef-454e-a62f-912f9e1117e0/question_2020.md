# Q2020: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` under the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction and force `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` apart from `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, breaking the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard for Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`: constrain the setup so that the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, fuzz the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool), and assert after every call that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard.
