# Q2278: NEAR callback gas budgeting callback refund creates value gap via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public finalization and fast-transfer flows with user-controlled `msg`` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens gas splitting plus callback consumers` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `callback refund creates value gap` under computes `ft_transfer_call` gas from prepaid minus used gas and falls back to strict minimum checks before minting or transferring, violating `callback gas budgeting must not let attacker-controlled message size or branching force a partial economic effect before the contract can safely resolve the outcome`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens gas splitting plus callback consumers`
- Entrypoint: `public finalization and fast-transfer flows with user-controlled `msg``
- Attacker controls: message length, gas left at call time, and whether the path chooses `ft_transfer` or `ft_transfer_call`
- Exploit idea: Target `ft_transfer_call`-style paths where refund semantics affect whether state is removed or custody is burned. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: callback gas budgeting must not let attacker-controlled message size or branching force a partial economic effect before the contract can safely resolve the outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Simulate every callback result and assert that no branch leaves both user-accessible funds and a still-live bridge claim for the same transfer. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
