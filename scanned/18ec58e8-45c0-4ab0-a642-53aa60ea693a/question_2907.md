# Q2907: merge-price via liquidate: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
`merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, use that to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, violating the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `merge-price` touches, run `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
