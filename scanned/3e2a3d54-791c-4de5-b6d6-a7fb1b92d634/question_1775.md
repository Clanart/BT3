# Q1775: Solana fake-bridged-token branch check asset-branch confusion on finalization through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public Solana init/finalize instructions when no vault exists` with control over mint authority, authority PDA, existence of the vault account, and mint registration timing and desynchronize `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/finalize_transfer.rs and init_transfer.rs` from the adjacent token-mapping and asset-identity logic that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `asset-branch confusion on finalization` attack class because treats a mint as bridged when the vault PDA does not exist and only checks that the mint authority is the bridge authority, violating `bridged/native branch detection must not let an attacker swap a fake bridge-controlled mint into a path intended only for canonical wrapped assets`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/finalize_transfer.rs and init_transfer.rs`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana init/finalize instructions when no vault exists`
- Attacker controls: mint authority, authority PDA, existence of the vault account, and mint registration timing
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent token-mapping and asset-identity logic.
- Invariant to test: bridged/native branch detection must not let an attacker swap a fake bridge-controlled mint into a path intended only for canonical wrapped assets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state. Also assert cross-module consistency between `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/finalize_transfer.rs and init_transfer.rs` and the adjacent token-mapping and asset-identity logic after every branch.
