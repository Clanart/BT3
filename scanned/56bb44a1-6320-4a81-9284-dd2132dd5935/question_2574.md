# Q2574: Duplicate queue or processing state in start_bitcoin_syncer_new_block_mined

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `start_bitcoin_syncer_new_block_mined` twice with attacker-controlled the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove context treated as canonical for a deposit and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/bitcoin_syncer.rs::start_bitcoin_syncer_new_block_mined
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
