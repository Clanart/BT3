# Q641: StateDB.SubBalance - Native Cache Rollback Restores Balance But Leaves Code Storage Dirty

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker execute a contract that moves EVM-denom value through nested calls through `EVM balance debit for CALL value, gas buy, or selfdestruct burn` while controlling `account deletion timing` and `SELFDESTRUCT target`, under the precondition that the sender has just enough EVM-denom balance for the transaction, drive `StateDB balance operation -> ExecuteNativeAction -> journal append -> Commit` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.SubBalance` so that native cache rollback restores balance but leaves code/storage dirty, violating the invariant that Commit must be all-or-nothing for balance, nonce, code, storage, logs, and events, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.SubBalance`
- Entrypoint: `EVM balance debit for CALL value, gas buy, or selfdestruct burn`
- Attacker controls: `account deletion timing`, `SELFDESTRUCT target`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: native cache rollback restores balance but leaves code/storage dirty through `StateDB balance operation -> ExecuteNativeAction -> journal append -> Commit`.
- Invariant to test: Commit must be all-or-nothing for balance, nonce, code, storage, logs, and events.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: compare IndexBlock/GetTransactionReceipt/GetBlockReceipts output against direct block/result reconstruction for the same transaction.
