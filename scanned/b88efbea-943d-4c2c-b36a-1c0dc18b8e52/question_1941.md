# Q1941: store_modified_entry ALT account explosion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store_modified_entry` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs around upgrade/close churn with upgrade timing, close/reopen timing, and repeated invocation of the same program id such that address lookup tables make this function handle a much larger effective account surface than the early admission logic prices, breaking the invariant that versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/loaded_programs.rs::store_modified_entry
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs around upgrade/close churn
- Attacker controls: upgrade timing, close/reopen timing, and repeated invocation of the same program id
- Exploit idea: use legal ALT expansion to amplify load, lock, or verification work
- Invariant to test: versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: benchmark identical logic with and without ALT expansion
