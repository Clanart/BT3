# Q2226: SmartWomConvert.smartConvert - obtained amount computed from arithmetic rather than from balance delta

## Question
wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol: _convertFor() sets obtainedmWomAmount = convertAmount + amountRec instead of measuring the mWOM balance delta, so any discrepancy between the router's reported output and the tokens actually received is absorbed by the contract's shared balance. Under womCash exceeds womLiability so maxSwapAmount returns zero and convertRatio stays at DENOMINATOR, is there an unprivileged sequence of `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` that leaves `amountRec from swapExactTokensForTokens` unreconciled with `convertAmount minted 1:1 by IMWom(mWom).deposit`, violates the invariant that the amount credited to a user must equal the balance the contract actually received for them, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol -> `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: obtained amount computed from arithmetic rather than from balance delta)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountIn and _mode, plus the pool state that currentRatio and maxSwapAmount are read from
- Exploit idea: _convertFor() sets obtainedmWomAmount = convertAmount + amountRec instead of measuring the mWOM balance delta, so any discrepancy between the router's reported output and the tokens actually received is absorbed by the contract's shared balance. Precondition: womCash exceeds womLiability so maxSwapAmount returns zero and convertRatio stays at DENOMINATOR.
- Invariant to test: the amount credited to a user must equal the balance the contract actually received for them; concretely, `amountRec from swapExactTokensForTokens` must stay reconciled with `convertAmount minted 1:1 by IMWom(mWom).deposit`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish womCash exceeds womLiability so maxSwapAmount returns zero and convertRatio stays at DENOMINATOR, have the attacker run `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `amountRec from swapExactTokensForTokens` versus `convertAmount minted 1:1 by IMWom(mWom).deposit` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
