# Q2840: remove_slots_le hot-stream starvation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove_slots_le` by submit transactions that churn the same pubkeys across old and new slots with same-pubkey churn across slots plus cleanup pressure so that one hot account/program/signature stream monopolizes work and starves other subscribers, breaking the invariant that one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::remove_slots_le
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that churn the same pubkeys across old and new slots
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey churn across slots plus cleanup pressure
- Exploit idea: measure cross-subscriber fairness
- Invariant to test: one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: pair a hot stream with a cheap control subscription
