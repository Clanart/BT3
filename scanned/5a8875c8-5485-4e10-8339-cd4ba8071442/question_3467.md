# Q3467: NEAR bind_token refund promise bookkeeping can be overwritten or orphaned through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `refund callback after public `bind_token`` with control over callback success or failure, predecessor account chosen for refund, and attached deposit and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token_refund` from the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `promise bookkeeping can be overwritten or orphaned` attack class because refunds either the explicit callback amount or the whole attached deposit after token-binding attempts, violating `refund logic must never let an attacker keep a successful binding while reclaiming the full deposit, or lose funds on a successful bind due to callback ordering`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token_refund`
- Entrypoint: `refund callback after public `bind_token``
- Attacker controls: callback success or failure, predecessor account chosen for refund, and attached deposit
- Exploit idea: Probe maps keyed only by account ids or derived storage accounts when multiple pending operations are possible. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: refund logic must never let an attacker keep a successful binding while reclaiming the full deposit, or lose funds on a successful bind due to callback ordering
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Create overlapping deferred operations and assert that each one has independent bookkeeping and cleanup. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token_refund` and the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping after every branch.
