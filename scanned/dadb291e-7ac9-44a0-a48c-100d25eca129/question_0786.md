# Q0786: WombatPoolHelper.withdraw - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Under the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, is there an unprivileged sequence of `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` that leaves `this.balance(msg.sender)` unreconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`, violates the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity and _minAmount, with the payout measured as a balance delta
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, have the attacker run `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `this.balance(msg.sender)` versus `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
