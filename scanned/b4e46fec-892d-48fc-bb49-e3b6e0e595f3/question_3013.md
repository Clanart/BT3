# Q3013: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getReward - InvalidRewardableAmount revert bricks a user's claims

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, _calExpireForfeit() reverts with InvalidRewardableAmount whenever rewardableAmount exceeds _amount, and rewardablePercentWAD is computed inside vlMGP from getUserTotalLocked, which itself can underflow, so a single inconsistent lock state makes every claim path for that user revert forever. Starting from a state where a large MGP distribution has just been queued and no account has settled yet, can an unprivileged EOA use `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` to leave `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` inconsistent with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`, violating the invariant that a pricing helper on the claim path must never be able to permanently block settlement and extracting Critical - Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: InvalidRewardableAmount revert bricks a user's claims)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the settlement timing, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim and through the locker's unlock path
- Exploit idea: _calExpireForfeit() reverts with InvalidRewardableAmount whenever rewardableAmount exceeds _amount, and rewardablePercentWAD is computed inside vlMGP from getUserTotalLocked, which itself can underflow, so a single inconsistent lock state makes every claim path for that user revert forever. Precondition: a large MGP distribution has just been queued and no account has settled yet.
- Invariant to test: a pricing helper on the claim path must never be able to permanently block settlement; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` sequence atomically under a large MGP distribution has just been queued and no account has settled yet, asserting at the end that `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` still equals `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
