# Q2710: accounts_cache.store slot-removal liveness bug

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store` by submit transactions that update many accounts in one slot with many writable accounts, repeated same-pubkey writes, and slot-boundary churn so that slot-removal logic can discard account data still needed by later state resolution, breaking the invariant that slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::store
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that update many accounts in one slot
- Attacker controls: many writable accounts, repeated same-pubkey writes, and slot-boundary churn
- Exploit idea: target old/new slot overlap for the same pubkey
- Invariant to test: slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn one pubkey across removable and non-removable slots
