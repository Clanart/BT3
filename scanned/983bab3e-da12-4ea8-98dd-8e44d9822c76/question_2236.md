# Q2236: EVM OmniBridge native/bridged branching one inbound event spawns multiple outbound obligations via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public EVM init/finalize entrypoints` and then replay or reorder the complementary outbound or inbound bridge leg so that `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::finTransfer and initTransfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `one inbound event spawns multiple outbound obligations` under selects between ETH release, ERC-1155 transfer, custom-minter mint/burn, bridge-token mint/burn, or plain ERC-20 custody based on mutable branch predicates, violating `branch selection must never be attacker-steerable toward a more profitable asset path than the one the signed or emitted payload actually authorizes`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::finTransfer and initTransfer`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM init/finalize entrypoints`
- Attacker controls: zero address versus token address, custom-minter registration, bridge-token registration, and message presence
- Exploit idea: Focus on forward-to-other-chain branches and fast-transfer substitution where an inbound event becomes a new pending transfer. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: branch selection must never be attacker-steerable toward a more profitable asset path than the one the signed or emitted payload actually authorizes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Track value and replay state across both the inbound leg and the forwarded leg and assert that one source event cannot increase total outstanding claims. Then replay or reorder the complementary outbound or inbound bridge leg and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
