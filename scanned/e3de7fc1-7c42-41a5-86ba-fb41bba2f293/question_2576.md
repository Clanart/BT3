# Q2576: active via borrow: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `active` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238` -> `active`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Reach it through `borrow` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers varied, and assert that the value `active` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
