# Q2310: retry_durable_nonce_transactions fee-payer unlock split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `retry_durable_nonce_transactions` by use json-rpc `sendtransaction` from one low-rate client with durable nonce transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and queue pressure such that fee-payer lock or unlock handling may diverge from the accounts actually charged later, breaking the invariant that fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs::retry_durable_nonce_transactions
- Entrypoint: use JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from one low-rate client
- Attacker controls: durable nonce transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and queue pressure
- Exploit idea: try to free or relock the fee payer at the wrong moment
- Invariant to test: fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace fee-payer lock state across retries, conflicts, and partial failures
