# Q4732: WombatPoolHelperV2.depositNative - receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` under an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert and force `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` apart from `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`, breaking the invariant that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution for Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Precondition: an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert.
- Invariant to test: the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (msg.value and _minimumLiquidity) under an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, asserting on every row that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution.
