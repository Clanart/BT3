# Q1714: Confuse replacement linkage in citrea_reveal_rbf_bumpfee_increases_feerate_and_mines

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings so `citrea_reveal_rbf_bumpfee_increases_feerate_and_mines` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the light-client proof context tied to a specific Bitcoin block to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/tests.rs::citrea_reveal_rbf_bumpfee_increases_feerate_and_mines
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
