# Q1849: NEAR remove_fast_transfer storage quote underestimates live state at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `internal helper reached from public callbacks and fee claims` with boundary-controlled inputs covering minimal deposits, maximal storage payloads, and withdrawal edges and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::remove_fast_transfer` violate `removal must not refund the wrong payer or reopen a fast transfer that can still influence claim, payout, or lock accounting` in the `storage quote underestimates live state` attack class because removes stored fast-transfer state and refunds reserved storage balance to the recorded storage owner becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::remove_fast_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `internal helper reached from public callbacks and fee claims`
- Attacker controls: fast-transfer id, storage owner, and timing relative to claim or refund
- Exploit idea: Target helper functions that quote storage for pending transfers, finalization records, fast transfers, binds, or deployments. Concentrate on minimal deposits, maximal storage payloads, and withdrawal edges.
- Invariant to test: removal must not refund the wrong payer or reopen a fast transfer that can still influence claim, payout, or lock accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Measure storage usage across maximal inputs and assert that quoted requirements always exceed or equal the true post-state footprint. Sweep boundary values for minimal deposits, maximal storage payloads, and withdrawal edges and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
