# Q865: Misbind trusted context inside insert_operator_kickoff_winternitz_public_keys_if_not_exist

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `insert_operator_kickoff_winternitz_public_keys_if_not_exist` through public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline and make attacker-controlled the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context bind to the wrong trusted context, so the deposit-to-move-tx binding is interpreted for one bridge action while authorizing another, violating the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/operator.rs::insert_operator_kickoff_winternitz_public_keys_if_not_exist
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context
- Exploit idea: bind attacker-controlled the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context to the wrong trusted bridge context
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
