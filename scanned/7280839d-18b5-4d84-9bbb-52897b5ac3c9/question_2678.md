# Q2678: remove flush-path service pinning

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads during account churn with read-after-delete and recreate patterns against the same accounts so that a legal transaction/read pattern can force this path into a flush-heavy mode that blocks unrelated work, breaking the invariant that background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs::remove
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads during account churn
- Attacker controls: read-after-delete and recreate patterns against the same accounts
- Exploit idea: treat flush pressure as the resource
- Invariant to test: background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: run churn-heavy writes plus immediate reads and measure latency inflation
