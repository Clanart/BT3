# Q1500: process_and_record_aged_transactions fee-payer unlock split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_and_record_aged_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with aged blockhashes, durable nonces, conflicting write sets, and batch scheduling order such that fee-payer lock or unlock handling may diverge from the accounts actually charged later, breaking the invariant that fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/banking_stage/consumer.rs::process_and_record_aged_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: aged blockhashes, durable nonces, conflicting write sets, and batch scheduling order
- Exploit idea: try to free or relock the fee payer at the wrong moment
- Invariant to test: fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace fee-payer lock state across retries, conflicts, and partial failures
