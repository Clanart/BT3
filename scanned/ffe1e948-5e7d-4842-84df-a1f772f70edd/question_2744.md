# Q2744: calc-utilization via collateral-remove: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) reach `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) varied, and assert that the value `calc-utilization` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
