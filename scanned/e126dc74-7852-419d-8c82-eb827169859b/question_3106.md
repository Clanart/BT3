# Q3106: filter_block_result_txs same-pubkey churn hotspot

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_block_result_txs` by use in-scope block subscriptions and hot block contents with block subscription filters, detail levels, and hot block streams so that rewriting one pubkey repeatedly creates pathological behavior that normal multi-pubkey load does not, breaking the invariant that hot-key churn should not create correctness or performance pathologies and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_block_result_txs
- Entrypoint: use in-scope block subscriptions and hot block contents
- Attacker controls: block subscription filters, detail levels, and hot block streams
- Exploit idea: use hot-key churn rather than broad fanout
- Invariant to test: hot-key churn should not create correctness or performance pathologies
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: compare same-pubkey rewrite churn against equally large multi-pubkey churn
