# Q3743: get-full-position via collateral-add: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
`get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing `amount`, use that to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-add` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
