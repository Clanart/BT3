# Q565: HookedStateDB.AddBalance - Tracer Mutation Affects Final Committed Logs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker request debug_trace* for crafted included transactions or calls through `debug/trace hooked EVM execution balance credit` while controlling `trace config` and `block context`, under the precondition that a Cronos-controlled operational path consumes trace output, drive `debug_trace* -> predecessor replay -> ApplyMessageWithConfig in trace context -> result marshaling` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb_hooked.go::HookedStateDB.AddBalance` so that tracer mutation affects final committed logs, violating the invariant that traceReplay must not mask balance/fee invariants, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb_hooked.go::HookedStateDB.AddBalance`
- Entrypoint: `debug/trace hooked EVM execution balance credit`
- Attacker controls: `trace config`, `block context`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: tracer mutation affects final committed logs through `debug_trace* -> predecessor replay -> ApplyMessageWithConfig in trace context -> result marshaling`.
- Invariant to test: traceReplay must not mask balance/fee invariants.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: add a fuzz case varying the attacker-controlled fields and differential-check against go-ethereum for tx validity, gas, nonce, and code/storage effects.
