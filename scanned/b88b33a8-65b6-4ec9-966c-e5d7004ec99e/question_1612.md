# Q1612: NEAR message-account funding helper storage payer or owner spoofing via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public init-transfer and resume flows through message-storage payment` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::try_to_transfer_balance_from_message_account` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `storage payer or owner spoofing` under moves NEAR from a calculated message account into a storage owner account before outbound transfer state is finalized, violating `message-account funding must not be spoofable or replayable in a way that funds one transfer while authorizing another`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::try_to_transfer_balance_from_message_account`
- Entrypoint: `public init-transfer and resume flows through message-storage payment`
- Attacker controls: message-storage account id, signer id, required storage, native fee, and transfer timing
- Exploit idea: Exploit signer/predecessor splits, message-storage account ids, or promise bookkeeping to shift storage liabilities between accounts. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: message-account funding must not be spoofable or replayable in a way that funds one transfer while authorizing another
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Simulate conflicting `sender_id`, `signer_id`, and pre-funded storage accounts and assert that only the intended payer can fund, resume, or recover that transfer. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
