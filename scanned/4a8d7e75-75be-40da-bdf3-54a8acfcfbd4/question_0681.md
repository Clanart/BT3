# Q681: NEAR fast_fin_transfer_to_near callback fee payout and storage refund overlap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit `callback after fast path storage checks for a Near recipient` so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fast_fin_transfer_to_near_callback` both refunds reserved storage and pays a fee out of the same economic event because of adds fast-transfer state, updates storage balances, emits a fast-transfer event, sends tokens immediately to the Near recipient, and later resolves the transfer via callback, violating `the fast-transfer record, recipient payout, and later burn/remove logic must stay symmetrical so immediate delivery cannot create unbacked or reclaimable supply`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fast_fin_transfer_to_near_callback`
- Entrypoint: `callback after fast path storage checks for a Near recipient`
- Attacker controls: storage-check result, relayer id, storage payer, fast transfer contents, `msg`, and token id
- Exploit idea: Target callbacks that remove state and refund storage while also minting or transferring fees.
- Invariant to test: the fast-transfer record, recipient payout, and later burn/remove logic must stay symmetrical so immediate delivery cannot create unbacked or reclaimable supply
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Model every success/failure order and assert that one event cannot produce both the intended fee and an unintended storage rebate for the attacker.
