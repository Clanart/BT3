# Q1183: NEAR resolve_utxo_fin_transfer delivery callback leaves inconsistent state at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `callback after sending tokens for UTXO-to-Near settlement` with boundary-controlled inputs covering zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::resolve_utxo_fin_transfer` violate `UTXO resolution must not leave the same origin transfer both payable and replayable after callback edge cases` in the `delivery callback leaves inconsistent state` attack class because interprets callback refund semantics and either removes tracked UTXO finalization state or emits the completed event becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::resolve_utxo_fin_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `callback after sending tokens for UTXO-to-Near settlement`
- Attacker controls: token id, amount, callback outcome, UTXO transfer message, origin chain, and storage owner
- Exploit idea: Focus on `ft_transfer_call`, unwrap callbacks, and post-delivery resolution that decide whether to burn, refund, or remove records. Concentrate on zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values.
- Invariant to test: UTXO resolution must not leave the same origin transfer both payable and replayable after callback edge cases
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Enumerate callback results and assert that each result maps to exactly one consistent combination of delivered value, replay state, and storage refund. Sweep boundary values for zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
