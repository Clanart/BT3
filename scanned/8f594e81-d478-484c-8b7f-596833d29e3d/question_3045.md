# Q3045: filter-u128 via collateral-remove: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the set of assets held, drive `filter-u128` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97) — which filters a 128-entry bucket list — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97` -> `filter-u128`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `filter-u128` touches, run `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
