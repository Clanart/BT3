# Q947: NEAR UTXO fast resolver final settlement and later fee claim can diverge via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public UTXO fast path reached through `ft_on_transfer`` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::utxo_fin_transfer_fast` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `final settlement and later fee claim can diverge` under finalizes or removes a UTXO fast transfer depending on whether the destination is Near or another chain, violating `the same UTXO fast-transfer id must not both pay a relayer immediately and remain claimable on a second leg`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::utxo_fin_transfer_fast`
- Entrypoint: `public UTXO fast path reached through `ft_on_transfer``
- Attacker controls: fast-transfer id, stored fast-transfer status, destination chain, amount, and relayer recipient
- Exploit idea: Target differences between settle-time denormalization and claim-time recomputation of fee, dust, or relayer substitution. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: the same UTXO fast-transfer id must not both pay a relayer immediately and remain claimable on a second leg
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Compare settled principal, stored transfer record, and fee-claim proof under edge amounts and assert that the three always reconstruct one consistent event. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
