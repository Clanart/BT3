# Q194: NEAR send_tokens helper burn or lock before irreversible state via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `internal helper reached from public finalize and fast paths` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `burn or lock before irreversible state` under chooses between wNEAR unwrap, bridge-token mint, `ft_transfer`, and `ft_transfer_call` depending on token type and message presence, violating `asset-delivery helper logic must not let attacker-controlled message shape or gas availability change the economic branch in a way that unbacks or strands funds`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens`
- Entrypoint: `internal helper reached from public finalize and fast paths`
- Attacker controls: token id, recipient account, amount, optional message, current gas budget, and whether the token is wNEAR, deployed, or external
- Exploit idea: Look for branches where custody changes happen before the final pending-state, mapping, or callback outcome is fixed. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: asset-delivery helper logic must not let attacker-controlled message shape or gas availability change the economic branch in a way that unbacks or strands funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Model failures between custody changes and state writes, then assert that no branch both consumes user value and allows the transfer to be replayed or dropped. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
