# Q189: AuthList.ToEthAuthList - Duplicate Authorizations Preserve Order Differently Than Geth

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit an EIP-7702 SetCode transaction through `EIP-7702 authorization list conversion` while controlling `zero-address clear tuple` and `authorization ChainID`, under the precondition that the EIP-7702 transaction later reverts or hits a post-hook failure, drive `SetCodeTx.Validate -> AuthList.ToEthAuthList -> validateAuthorization -> applyAuthorization` in `x/evm/types/auth_list.go::AuthList.ToEthAuthList` so that duplicate authorizations preserve order differently than geth, violating the invariant that duplicate authorizations must produce the same result as geth, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/types/auth_list.go::AuthList.ToEthAuthList`
- Entrypoint: `EIP-7702 authorization list conversion`
- Attacker controls: `zero-address clear tuple`, `authorization ChainID`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: duplicate authorizations preserve order differently than geth through `SetCodeTx.Validate -> AuthList.ToEthAuthList -> validateAuthorization -> applyAuthorization`.
- Invariant to test: duplicate authorizations must produce the same result as geth.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: force the edge value at uint64/uint256/sdk.Int boundaries and assert no smaller debit, larger refund, or supply change occurs.
