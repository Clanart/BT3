# Q2399: from clvm derive a different canonical hash via big integer encodings

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker decode attacker-controlled CLVM targeting `from_clvm` in `crates/clvm-traits/src/from_clvm.rs` with big integer encodings when equivalent-looking encodings are mixed make chia_rs derive a different canonical hash, violating the invariant that CLVM atom encodings have canonical typed meanings, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-traits/src/from_clvm.rs:246` / `from_clvm`
- Entrypoint: decode attacker-controlled CLVM
- Attacker controls: big integer encodings
- Exploit idea: Drive `from_clvm` through its public caller path using big integer encodings; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: CLVM atom encodings have canonical typed meanings
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption
- Fast validation: fuzz CLVM atoms and lists and assert typed decoding matches clvmr semantics.
