# Q2142: get-full-position via liquidate-redeem: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the borrower targeted, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the borrower targeted across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `get-full-position` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
