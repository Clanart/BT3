# Q5519: WombatPoolHelperV2.depositNative - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol - none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling msg.value and _minimumLiquidity, under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, exploit this through `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` to break the reconciliation between `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` and the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard, yielding Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`: constrain the setup so that the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, fuzz the attacker inputs (msg.value and _minimumLiquidity), and assert after every call that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard.
