# Q3459: BlockGasLimit - Consensus Params Differ Between Rpc Context And Finalizeblock

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `block gas limit lookup for EVM execution and estimates` while controlling `multi-message ordering` and `refund counter`, under the precondition that the sender has just enough EVM-denom balance for the advertised cost, drive `VerifyFee -> DeductTxCostsFromUserBalance -> ApplyMessageWithConfig -> RefundGasWithPrice` in `types/block.go::BlockGasLimit` so that consensus params differ between RPC context and FinalizeBlock, violating the invariant that gas limits below intrinsic or floor-data gas must not commit, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `types/block.go::BlockGasLimit`
- Entrypoint: `block gas limit lookup for EVM execution and estimates`
- Attacker controls: `multi-message ordering`, `refund counter`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: consensus params differ between RPC context and FinalizeBlock through `VerifyFee -> DeductTxCostsFromUserBalance -> ApplyMessageWithConfig -> RefundGasWithPrice`.
- Invariant to test: gas limits below intrinsic or floor-data gas must not commit.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: build a two-message Cosmos tx fixture and assert ante, execution, refund, and receipt invariants after FinalizeBlock.
