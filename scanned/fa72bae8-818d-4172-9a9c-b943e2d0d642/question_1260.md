# Q1260: convert-to-scaled-debt via liquidate: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `borrower`, any third-party principal reach `convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `borrower`, any third-party principal across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `convert-to-scaled-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
