# Q3990: WombatPoolHelper.depositLP - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, where the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Assuming the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` via `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`, breaking the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value and producing Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`: constrain the setup so that the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, fuzz the attacker inputs (_lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller), and assert after every call that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value.
