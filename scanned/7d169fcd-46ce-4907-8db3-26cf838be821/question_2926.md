# Q2926: merge-price via collateral-add: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling call ordering within the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-add` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with call ordering within the block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
