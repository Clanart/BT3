# Q5045: convert-to-scaled-debt via collateral-add: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, drive `convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) — which scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the position's existing collateral and debt composition, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
