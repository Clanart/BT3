# Q2912: increment via collateral-add: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position's existing collateral and debt composition reach `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it advances the user-id nonce, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `collateral-add` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the position's existing collateral and debt composition varied, and assert that the value `increment` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
