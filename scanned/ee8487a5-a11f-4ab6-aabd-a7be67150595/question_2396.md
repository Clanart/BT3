# Q2396: from clvm allow replay across contexts via curried program argument trees

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker serialize typed values back into CLVM targeting `from_clvm` in `crates/clvm-traits/src/from_clvm.rs` with curried program argument trees when the payload is accepted by one public API before another validates it make chia_rs allow replay across contexts, violating the invariant that FromClvm and ToClvm round trips preserve semantics, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-traits/src/from_clvm.rs:199` / `from_clvm`
- Entrypoint: serialize typed values back into CLVM
- Attacker controls: curried program argument trees
- Exploit idea: Drive `from_clvm` through its public caller path using curried program argument trees; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: FromClvm and ToClvm round trips preserve semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption
- Fast validation: fuzz CLVM atoms and lists and assert typed decoding matches clvmr semantics.
