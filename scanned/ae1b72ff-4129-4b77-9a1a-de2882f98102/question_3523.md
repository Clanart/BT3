# Q3523: get-egroup via supply-collateral-add: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
`get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `amount`, use that to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, then read `get-egroup` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
