# Q3866: resolve-ststx via borrow: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the future mask produced by the new debt bit, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-ststx` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339` -> `resolve-ststx`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `borrow` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the future mask produced by the new debt bit varied, and assert that the value `resolve-ststx` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
