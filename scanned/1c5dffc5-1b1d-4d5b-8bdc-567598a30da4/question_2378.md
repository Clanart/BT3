# Q2378: clean_accounts flush-path service pinning

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `clean_accounts` by submit transactions that create, drain, resize, and recreate many accounts with high-churn account creation/close patterns and repeated zero-lamport transitions so that a legal transaction/read pattern can force this path into a flush-heavy mode that blocks unrelated work, breaking the invariant that background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::clean_accounts
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that create, drain, resize, and recreate many accounts
- Attacker controls: high-churn account creation/close patterns and repeated zero-lamport transitions
- Exploit idea: treat flush pressure as the resource
- Invariant to test: background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: run churn-heavy writes plus immediate reads and measure latency inflation
