# Q3154: filter_signature_result remove-unrooted state loss

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_signature_result` by use in-scope signature subscriptions and many status changes with signature subscription parameters and hot status churn so that state the runtime or RPC still needs can be removed because slot liveness assumptions are too aggressive, breaking the invariant that only truly unreachable unrooted state should be removed and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_signature_result
- Entrypoint: use in-scope signature subscriptions and many status changes
- Attacker controls: signature subscription parameters and hot status churn
- Exploit idea: look for premature removal under churn
- Invariant to test: only truly unreachable unrooted state should be removed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: drive fast fork/root churn with attacker-owned accounts and verify consistency afterward
