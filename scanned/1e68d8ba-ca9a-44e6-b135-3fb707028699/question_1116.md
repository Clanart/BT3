# Q1116: Race create_operator_sighash_stream across concurrent state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch, retry, or reorder public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline interactions around the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests so `create_operator_sighash_stream` observes inconsistent state across memory, database, and on-chain checks, breaking the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, and leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/builder/sighash.rs::create_operator_sighash_stream
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests
- Exploit idea: use retries, batching, or timing around the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests to desynchronize state
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
