# Q2862: Tier Price Underpayment With Duplicate Or Reordered Items

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BandwidthManager.purchase(...) -> pallet_ismp::handle_unsigned(origin=None, messages)` with attacker-controlled authenticated purchase messages, app and chain identifiers, tier configuration values, and replay ordering and placing duplicate or reordered leaves, signatures, requests, responses, timeouts, or commitments inside one user-accessible batch, and make `try_from` buy more bandwidth than paid for by exploiting scaling, rounding, or token-decimal representation gaps so `the credited bandwidth or tier-month value` becomes inconsistent with `the amount actually paid in the configured fee token`, breaking the invariant that bandwidth credit must scale exactly with configured tier price, months purchased, and fee-token decimals and leading to High: valid activity resolves to the wrong beneficiary, wrong token amount, wrong reward amount, or wrong order value?

## Target
- File/function: modules/pallets/bandwidth/src/abi.rs::try_from
- Entrypoint: BandwidthManager.purchase(...) -> pallet_ismp::handle_unsigned(origin=None, messages)
- Attacker controls: authenticated purchase messages, app and chain identifiers, tier configuration values, and replay ordering
- Exploit idea: Buy more bandwidth than paid for by exploiting scaling, rounding, or token-decimal representation gaps. Use a batch with one honest item and one duplicated or reordered item to see whether unique-item assumptions collapse.
- Invariant to test: bandwidth credit must scale exactly with configured tier price, months purchased, and fee-token decimals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: valid activity resolves to the wrong beneficiary, wrong token amount, wrong reward amount, or wrong order value.
- Fast validation: Vary fee-token decimals, tier prices, and month counts and assert the credited subscription value equals the payment implied by configuration. Write a focused batch test with repeated indices or commitments and assert only unique authenticated items can affect state.
