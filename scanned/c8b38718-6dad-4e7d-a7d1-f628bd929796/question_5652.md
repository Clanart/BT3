# Q5652: MasterMagpie.massUpdatePools - lpSupply inflation by direct token donation

## Question
Consider rewards/MasterMagpie.sol, where _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Assuming the contract has just been unpaused and lastRewardTimestamp is far behind block.timestamp, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `tokenToPoolInfo[_stakingToken].lastRewardTimestamp` and `block.timestamp` via `massUpdatePools()`, breaking the invariant that MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply and producing High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `massUpdatePools()` (mechanism: lpSupply inflation by direct token donation)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `massUpdatePools()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the block in which every registered pool is rolled forward at once
- Exploit idea: _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Precondition: the contract has just been unpaused and lastRewardTimestamp is far behind block.timestamp.
- Invariant to test: MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply; concretely, `tokenToPoolInfo[_stakingToken].lastRewardTimestamp` must stay reconciled with `block.timestamp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the contract has just been unpaused and lastRewardTimestamp is far behind block.timestamp, then assert `tokenToPoolInfo[_stakingToken].lastRewardTimestamp` and `block.timestamp` end identical in both runs.
