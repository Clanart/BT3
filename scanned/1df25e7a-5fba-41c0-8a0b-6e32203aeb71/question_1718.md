# Q1718: accrue-collateral-asset via redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption varied, and assert that the value `accrue-collateral-asset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
