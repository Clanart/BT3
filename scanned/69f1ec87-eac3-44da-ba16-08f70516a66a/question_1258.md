# Q1258: Starknet log_metadata native versus wrapped registration confusion at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Starknet metadata logging entrypoint` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::log_metadata` violate `metadata parsing across old and new Starknet token ABIs must not let one token produce ambiguous asset identity data on other chains` in the `native versus wrapped registration confusion` attack class because performs low-level calls to infer whether metadata fields are returned as `felt252` or `ByteArray`, then emits a `LogMetadata` event becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::log_metadata`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet metadata logging entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: token address and the token’s reported `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` ABI behavior
- Exploit idea: Target vault-existence checks, deployed-token caches, origin-chain inference, and custom-minter registration. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: metadata parsing across old and new Starknet token ABIs must not let one token produce ambiguous asset identity data on other chains
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Flip each classification predicate around existing mappings and assert that deployment and later settlement always preserve the same custody model. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
