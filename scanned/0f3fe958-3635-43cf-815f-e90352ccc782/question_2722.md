# Q2722: accounts_cache.load index inconsistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by submit transactions plus immediate reads for recently changed accounts with same-pubkey churn plus immediate readback so that indexes or lookup tables updated around this function can disagree with the stored account payloads they point to, breaking the invariant that indexes must resolve to the exact account version later returned to rpc or runtime callers and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::load
- Entrypoint: submit transactions plus immediate reads for recently changed accounts
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey churn plus immediate readback
- Exploit idea: force same-pubkey and same-owner churn to look for torn index state
- Invariant to test: indexes must resolve to the exact account version later returned to RPC or runtime callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare indexed reads to direct storage reads during high-churn updates
