# Q1224: send-underlying via deposit: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge reach `send-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296` -> `send-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Reach it through `deposit` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `send-underlying` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
