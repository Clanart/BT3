# Q0453: node_pubkey_offset charges far less than it costs (frame_v1_14_11.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `node_pubkey_offset` in `vote/src/vote_state_view/frame_v1_14_11.rs` with an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure, and make the real CPU/memory cost of `node_pubkey_offset` exceed the units charged for it, so that the invariant "Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_state_view/frame_v1_14_11.rs` -> `node_pubkey_offset()` (around line 60)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure
- Exploit idea: Find the input shape where `node_pubkey_offset`'s real CPU/memory/IO cost grows much faster than the compute units or fee charged for it.
- Invariant to test: Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Measure real time/allocations versus units charged across input sizes; assert cost/CU ratio stays bounded.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can perform syscall, CPI, memory-mapping, or deserialization work whose real CPU/memory cost far exceeds the compute units charged, degrading nodes below true cost.
