# Q1093: calc-index-next via borrow: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, drive `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) — which applies a multiplier to the current index — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `borrow` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, then read `calc-index-next` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
