# Q5982: filter-u128 via collateral-remove: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the set of assets held, can an unprivileged attacker make `filter-u128` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97` -> `filter-u128`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the set of assets held across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `filter-u128` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
