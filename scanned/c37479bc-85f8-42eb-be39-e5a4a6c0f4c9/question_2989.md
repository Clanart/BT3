# Q2989: notify_vote watcher leak on disconnect

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_vote` by subscribe to votes and then drive hot transaction flow that affects vote visibility with vote subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot notification streams so that disconnect/unsubscribe races leave watcher state or queued notifications behind, breaking the invariant that watcher teardown must reclaim all state promptly and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_vote
- Entrypoint: subscribe to votes and then drive hot transaction flow that affects vote visibility
- Attacker controls: vote subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot notification streams
- Exploit idea: stress teardown paths
- Invariant to test: watcher teardown must reclaim all state promptly
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: rapidly connect/disconnect and compare live watcher counts before and after
