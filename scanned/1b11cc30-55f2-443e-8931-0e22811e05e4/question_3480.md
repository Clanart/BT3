# Q3480: current_shopify_session_id: An id_token replayed after the exchange to obtain a persisted o...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params) reach `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb via GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy, supplying an id_token replayed after the exchange to obtain a persisted offline token for a shop the attacker only transiently controls, so that session id must come from a fully verified id_token (sig, aud, dest, exp) before any load or exchange is violated, leading to authentication bypass / minting an access token for a shop the attacker does not own? Specifically confirm that merchant A can never load, write, or act with merchant B's session, token, or scopes.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb — `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange`
- Entrypoint: GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params — specifically an id_token replayed after the exchange to obtain a persisted offline token for a shop the attacker only transiently controls.
- Exploit idea: Perform the flow as merchant A while naming shop/user B and confirm no B-scoped data is reachable.
- Invariant to test: session id must come from a fully verified id_token (sig, aud, dest, exp) before any load or exchange
- Expected Immunefi impact: authentication bypass / minting an access token for a shop the attacker does not own (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: two-tenant integration test asserting A's request never loads, writes, or acts with B's session/token.
