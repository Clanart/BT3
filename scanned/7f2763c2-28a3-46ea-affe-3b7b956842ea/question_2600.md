# Q2600: consume_scan_should_process_packet panics on attacker-reachable input (vote_worker.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `consume_scan_should_process_packet` in `core/src/banking_stage/vote_worker.rs` with amounts split across many transactions so per-step rounding accumulates, and reach an unchecked unwrap, slice index, or assertion inside `consume_scan_should_process_packet`, so that the invariant "No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/banking_stage/vote_worker.rs` -> `consume_scan_should_process_packet()` (around line 445)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: amounts split across many transactions so per-step rounding accumulates
- Exploit idea: Reach `consume_scan_should_process_packet` with input that trips an unwrap, slice index, `expect`, division, or debug assertion, aborting the process on every node that replays the block.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz `consume_scan_should_process_packet` with `cargo fuzz`/proptest over its attacker-controlled arguments; assert no panic, only `Result::Err`.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft bytecode, ELF metadata, precompile data, or zk proof input that panics, aborts, infinite-loops, or exhausts memory inside the VM and halts every validator.
