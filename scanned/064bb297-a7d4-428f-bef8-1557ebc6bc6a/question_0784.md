# Q0784: current_shopify_session: A request with NO id_token and only a cookie, forcing `current_...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` URL param, the Authorization: Bearer header, `shop`, `host`, `session`, and the encrypted session cookie value) reach `current_shopify_session / load_current_session` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb via GET any EnsureHasSession-protected controller action (legacy auth strategy), supplying a request with NO id_token and only a cookie, forcing `current_session_id` to derive identity from the cookie alone, so that the activated session must belong to the shop/user proven by a verified id_token, not by an unverified cookie or param is violated, leading to session fixation / use of another merchant's session (unauthorized data access)? Specifically confirm that the derived shop/user/signature equals the canonical Shopify-asserted value for every input.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb — `current_shopify_session / load_current_session`
- Entrypoint: GET any EnsureHasSession-protected controller action (legacy auth strategy)
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` URL param, the Authorization: Bearer header, `shop`, `host`, `session`, and the encrypted session cookie value — specifically a request with NO id_token and only a cookie, forcing `current_session_id` to derive identity from the cookie alone.
- Exploit idea: Compare the value the gem derives from the attacker input against the value Shopify actually signed/asserted.
- Invariant to test: the activated session must belong to the shop/user proven by a verified id_token, not by an unverified cookie or param
- Expected Immunefi impact: session fixation / use of another merchant's session (unauthorized data access) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: differential test: feed the crafted input to the parsing/verification method and diff derived vs. canonical shop/user/signature.
