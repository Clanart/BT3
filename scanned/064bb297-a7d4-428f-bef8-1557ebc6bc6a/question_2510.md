# Q2510: redirect_uri_for_embedded: An attacker Referer feeding `referer_sanitized_shop_name` into ...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`shop`, `host`, `embedded`, `redirect_uri`, and all other query params (echoed via sanitized_params)) reach `redirect_uri_for_embedded / add_app_bridge_redirect_url_header` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/redirect_for_embedded.rb via GET an EnsureInstalled action with embedded=1 and no known shop session, supplying an attacker Referer feeding `referer_sanitized_shop_name` into the redirect shop, so that the composed embedded redirect must target the app's own login on a trusted origin is violated, leading to open redirect leaking OAuth/session params to attacker origin? Specifically confirm that the malicious input stays rejected across refactors (pinned fixture).

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/redirect_for_embedded.rb — `redirect_uri_for_embedded / add_app_bridge_redirect_url_header`
- Entrypoint: GET an EnsureInstalled action with embedded=1 and no known shop session
- Attacker controls: `shop`, `host`, `embedded`, `redirect_uri`, and all other query params (echoed via sanitized_params) — specifically an attacker Referer feeding `referer_sanitized_shop_name` into the redirect shop.
- Exploit idea: Encode the exact malicious input as a fixture so a future refactor can't silently reopen the hole.
- Invariant to test: the composed embedded redirect must target the app's own login on a trusted origin
- Expected Immunefi impact: open redirect leaking OAuth/session params to attacker origin (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: regression fixture pinning the malicious input to a rejected outcome for CI.
