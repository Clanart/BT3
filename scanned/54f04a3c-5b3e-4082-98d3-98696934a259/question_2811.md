# Q2811: Solana UsedNonces::use_nonce storage quote underestimates live state via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public nonce-tracking path through `finalize_transfer` instructions` and then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs::use_nonce` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `storage quote underestimates live state` under tracks nonce usage in bit arrays, updates `max_used_nonce`, and compensates or charges rent to the authority reserve as nonce ranges expand, violating `nonce tracking must reject every replay while keeping reserve accounting exact, even under gaps, huge nonces, or interleaved PDA initialization`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs::use_nonce`
- Entrypoint: `public nonce-tracking path through `finalize_transfer` instructions`
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, used-nonces PDA slot, payer funding, authority PDA lamports, and nonce gaps
- Exploit idea: Target helper functions that quote storage for pending transfers, finalization records, fast transfers, binds, or deployments. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: nonce tracking must reject every replay while keeping reserve accounting exact, even under gaps, huge nonces, or interleaved PDA initialization
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Measure storage usage across maximal inputs and assert that quoted requirements always exceed or equal the true post-state footprint. Then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
