# Q3335: calc-liq-debt-repay-real via liquidate: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`calc-liq-debt-repay-real` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:733) re-derives debt from capped collateral by dividing by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `debt-amount`, use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:733` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay-real`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` re-derives debt from capped collateral by dividing by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Reach it through `liquidate` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `debt-amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
