# Q12: Purchase-Message Misbinding By Reusing Data Cross Module

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `HandlerV2.handlePostRequests(IHost host, request) -> BandwidthManager.onAccept` with attacker-controlled purchase parameters, app and chain bytes, authenticated inbound purchase or governance messages, and fee-token decimals and reusing data that should belong to one chain, module, order, state machine, or payee in another publicly reachable path, and make `onAccept` apply a privileged purchase, tier update, or withdrawal action from the wrong source module so `the trusted source of bandwidth governance or purchase messages` becomes inconsistent with `the exact Hyperbridge module that is allowed to issue that action`, breaking the invariant that cross-chain bandwidth actions must authenticate both source chain and source module before changing credit or withdrawing assets and leading to Critical: unauthenticated cross-chain governance or host-management execution?

## Target
- File/function: evm/src/apps/BandwidthManager.sol::onAccept
- Entrypoint: HandlerV2.handlePostRequests(IHost host, request) -> BandwidthManager.onAccept
- Attacker controls: purchase parameters, app and chain bytes, authenticated inbound purchase or governance messages, and fee-token decimals
- Exploit idea: Apply a privileged purchase, tier update, or withdrawal action from the wrong source module. Craft two public flows that share one byte string or hash and check whether module, chain, or payee binding is enforced everywhere.
- Invariant to test: cross-chain bandwidth actions must authenticate both source chain and source module before changing credit or withdrawing assets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: unauthenticated cross-chain governance or host-management execution.
- Fast validation: Route a valid-looking message from the wrong Hyperbridge source module and assert no tier change, withdrawal, or credit mutation occurs. Feed the same bytes through two reachable entrypoints and assert the second path rejects instead of inheriting the first path's authorization.
