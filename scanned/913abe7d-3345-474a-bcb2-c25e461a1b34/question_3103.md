# Q3103: Solana deploy_token fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Solana `deploy_token` instruction` with boundary-controlled inputs covering decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::deploy_token` violate `one signed remote asset identity must map to one mint PDA and one metadata record with no collision or decimal mismatch` in the `fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical` attack class because verifies a NEAR-derived signature, creates a mint PDA from a hashed token string, writes metadata, and posts the new mint registration back to Near becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::deploy_token`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `deploy_token` instruction`
- Attacker controls: signed payload bytes, token string, name, symbol, decimals, payer funding, and derived PDA seeds
- Exploit idea: Target checks that only inspect mint authority, owner, or one mapping row without proving the full asset identity. Concentrate on decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges.
- Invariant to test: one signed remote asset identity must map to one mint PDA and one metadata record with no collision or decimal mismatch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Construct plausible fake bridge-controlled assets and assert that deployment, settlement, and forwarding reject them unless they are the canonical mapping for that remote asset. Sweep boundary values for decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
