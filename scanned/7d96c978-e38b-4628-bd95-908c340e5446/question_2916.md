# Q2916: Keeper.SetBalance - State Override Path Reaches Keeper Setbalance With Commit True

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker execute a contract that moves EVM-denom value through nested calls through `keeper bank balance set used by StateDB overrides` while controlling `native action writes` and `storage dirty keys`, under the precondition that the sender has just enough EVM-denom balance for the transaction, drive `EVM CALL/SELFDESTRUCT -> StateDB native cache -> RevertToSnapshot -> Commit` in `x/evm/keeper/statedb.go::Keeper.SetBalance` so that state override path reaches keeper SetBalance with commit=true, violating the invariant that journaled reverts must roll back native bank writes and EVM dirty state together, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/statedb.go::Keeper.SetBalance`
- Entrypoint: `keeper bank balance set used by StateDB overrides`
- Attacker controls: `native action writes`, `storage dirty keys`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: state override path reaches keeper SetBalance with commit=true through `EVM CALL/SELFDESTRUCT -> StateDB native cache -> RevertToSnapshot -> Commit`.
- Invariant to test: journaled reverts must roll back native bank writes and EVM dirty state together.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: replay the same scenario through eth_call or estimateGas and through eth_sendRawTransaction and assert the only difference is persistence.
