# Q2927: ValidateEthBasic - Authinfo Fee Amount Diverges From Summed Ethereum Fees

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a Cosmos-wrapped Ethereum transaction through `Ethereum extension-option ante basic validation` while controlling `chain ID` and `message ordering`, under the precondition that the same Cosmos tx contains more than one MsgEthereumTx, drive `NewAnteHandler route selection -> Ethereum ante decorators -> MsgEthereumTx execution` in `ante/interfaces/setup.go::ValidateEthBasic` so that AuthInfo fee amount diverges from summed Ethereum fees, violating the invariant that fee/gas AuthInfo must equal the embedded Ethereum tx data, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `ante/interfaces/setup.go::ValidateEthBasic`
- Entrypoint: `Ethereum extension-option ante basic validation`
- Attacker controls: `chain ID`, `message ordering`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: AuthInfo fee amount diverges from summed Ethereum fees through `NewAnteHandler route selection -> Ethereum ante decorators -> MsgEthereumTx execution`.
- Invariant to test: fee/gas AuthInfo must equal the embedded Ethereum tx data.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: build a two-message Cosmos tx fixture and assert ante, execution, refund, and receipt invariants after FinalizeBlock.
