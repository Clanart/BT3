# Q2894: Keeper.TraceTx - Block Context Height Time Changes Fork Rules During Replay

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker request debug_trace* for crafted included transactions or calls through `public debug_traceTransaction replay of included transaction` while controlling `predecessor tx list` and `baseFee`, under the precondition that traceReplay or state overrides are enabled, drive `TraceCall/TraceBlock -> block context setup -> hooked StateDB execution` in `x/evm/keeper/grpc_query.go::Keeper.TraceTx` so that block context height/time changes fork rules during replay, violating the invariant that trace results must map to the exact target transaction, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/grpc_query.go::Keeper.TraceTx`
- Entrypoint: `public debug_traceTransaction replay of included transaction`
- Attacker controls: `predecessor tx list`, `baseFee`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: block context height/time changes fork rules during replay through `TraceCall/TraceBlock -> block context setup -> hooked StateDB execution`.
- Invariant to test: trace results must map to the exact target transaction.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: compare IndexBlock/GetTransactionReceipt/GetBlockReceipts output against direct block/result reconstruction for the same transaction.
