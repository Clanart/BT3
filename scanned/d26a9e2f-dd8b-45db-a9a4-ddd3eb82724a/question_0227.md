# Q227: Accept wrong proof/network context in prove_and_get_non_targeted_block

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context through broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation so `prove_and_get_non_targeted_block` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/header_chain_prover.rs::prove_and_get_non_targeted_block
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
