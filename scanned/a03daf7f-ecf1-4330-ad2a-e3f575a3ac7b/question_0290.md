# Q290: Keeper.CalculateBaseFee - Mingasprice Truncation Lowers Basefee Below Required Minimum

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker fill adjacent blocks with carefully priced public transactions through `BeginBlock base-fee calculation from previous block gas` while controlling `NoBaseFee` and `MinGasMultiplier`, under the precondition that the previous block includes block-gas-exceeded or high-refund transactions, drive `BlockGasUsed/BlockGasWanted accounting -> MinGasMultiplier -> next-block baseFee` in `x/feemarket/keeper/eip1559.go::Keeper.CalculateBaseFee` so that MinGasPrice truncation lowers baseFee below required minimum, violating the invariant that baseFee must be deterministic and reflect charged block gas, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/feemarket/keeper/eip1559.go::Keeper.CalculateBaseFee`
- Entrypoint: `BeginBlock base-fee calculation from previous block gas`
- Attacker controls: `NoBaseFee`, `MinGasMultiplier`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: MinGasPrice truncation lowers baseFee below required minimum through `BlockGasUsed/BlockGasWanted accounting -> MinGasMultiplier -> next-block baseFee`.
- Invariant to test: baseFee must be deterministic and reflect charged block gas.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: construct a contract harness that performs nested CALL/CREATE/SELFDESTRUCT/revert and compare bank keeper balances with StateDB balances.
