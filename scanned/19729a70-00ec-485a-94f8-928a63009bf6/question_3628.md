# Q3628: WombatPoolHelperV2.harvest - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol - the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling the harvest timing for the whole pool, under a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, exploit this through `harvest()` to break the reconciliation between `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` and `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` and the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value, yielding Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the harvest timing for the whole pool
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, then assert `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` and `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` end identical in both runs.
