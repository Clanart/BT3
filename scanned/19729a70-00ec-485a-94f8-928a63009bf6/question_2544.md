# Q2544: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getReward - totalStaked and balanceOf drawn from unrelated sources

## Question
rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol: totalStaked() reads IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply() while balanceOf() reads MasterMagpie's UserInfo.amount for the same account, so the numerator and the denominator of every reward computation come from two independently maintained ledgers. Under the computed forfeit lands just above the _amount / 1000 dust threshold, is there an unprivileged sequence of `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` that leaves `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` unreconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`, violates the invariant that sum of balanceOf over all accounts must equal totalStaked at all times, and delivers Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: totalStaked and balanceOf drawn from unrelated sources)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the settlement timing, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim and through the locker's unlock path
- Exploit idea: totalStaked() reads IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply() while balanceOf() reads MasterMagpie's UserInfo.amount for the same account, so the numerator and the denominator of every reward computation come from two independently maintained ledgers. Precondition: the computed forfeit lands just above the _amount / 1000 dust threshold.
- Invariant to test: sum of balanceOf over all accounts must equal totalStaked at all times; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` sequence atomically under the computed forfeit lands just above the _amount / 1000 dust threshold, asserting at the end that `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` still equals `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
