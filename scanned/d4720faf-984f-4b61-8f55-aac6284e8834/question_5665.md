# Q5665: active via collateral-remove: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the set of assets held, drive `active` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238) — which lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238` -> `active`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, then read `active` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
