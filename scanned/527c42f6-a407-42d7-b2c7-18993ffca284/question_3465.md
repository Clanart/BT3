# Q3465: NEAR bind_token entry refund goes to wrong logical owner through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public `bind_token` proof-submission flow` with control over proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and timing versus token deployment and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token` from the adjacent token-mapping and asset-identity logic that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `refund goes to wrong logical owner` attack class because verifies a deploy-token proof, writes token mappings in `bind_token_callback`, then refunds leftover deposit in a second callback, violating `binding an existing Near token to a foreign asset must remain one-to-one and fully collateral-accounted across proof replay, partial failure, and refund paths`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token`
- Entrypoint: `public `bind_token` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and timing versus token deployment
- Exploit idea: Target asynchronous state removal, carried predecessor identities, and stored owner fields. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent token-mapping and asset-identity logic.
- Invariant to test: binding an existing Near token to a foreign asset must remain one-to-one and fully collateral-accounted across proof replay, partial failure, and refund paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Trace refund ownership across success and failure branches and assert that only the original funder can recover the reserved storage. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token` and the adjacent token-mapping and asset-identity logic after every branch.
