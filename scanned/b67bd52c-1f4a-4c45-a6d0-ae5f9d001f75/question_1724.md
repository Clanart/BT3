# Q1724: Confuse replacement linkage in send_aggregate_txs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering so `send_aggregate_txs` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the storage slot/value pair used to prove deposit or withdrawal state to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/sync.rs::send_aggregate_txs
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
