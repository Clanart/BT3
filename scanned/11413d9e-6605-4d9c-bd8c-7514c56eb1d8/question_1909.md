# Q1909: WombatBribeManager.voteAndCast - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Under the attacker locks vlMGP, votes and casts inside a single transaction, is there an unprivileged sequence of `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)` that leaves `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]` unreconciled with `IBribeRewardPool(pool.rewarder).balanceOf(user)`, violates the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates, and delivers Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the deltas and the atomic vote-then-cast ordering inside one transaction
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the attacker locks vlMGP, votes and casts inside a single transaction.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]` must stay reconciled with `IBribeRewardPool(pool.rewarder).balanceOf(user)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (the deltas and the atomic vote-then-cast ordering inside one transaction) under the attacker locks vlMGP, votes and casts inside a single transaction, asserting on every row that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates.
