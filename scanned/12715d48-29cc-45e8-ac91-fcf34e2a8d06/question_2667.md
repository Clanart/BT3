# Q2667: read_only_accounts_cache.store queue-drain mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that cause cache population for large accounts with repeated reads of large or frequently changing accounts so that the queue behind this function drains more slowly than one valid subscription shape can fill it even at realistic rates, breaking the invariant that one valid subscription must not create a persistently negative drain ratio and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs::store
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that cause cache population for large accounts
- Attacker controls: repeated reads of large or frequently changing accounts
- Exploit idea: treat steady-state drain ratio as the invariant
- Invariant to test: one valid subscription must not create a persistently negative drain ratio
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: measure fill/drain ratio for the hottest legal notification source
