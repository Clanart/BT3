# Q5607: write-feed via borrow: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `borrow` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `write-feed` touches, run `borrow` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
