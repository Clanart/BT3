# Q0910: get-asset-value via liquidate-redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
