# Q1678: get-egroup via borrow: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the future mask produced by the new debt bit, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `borrow` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
