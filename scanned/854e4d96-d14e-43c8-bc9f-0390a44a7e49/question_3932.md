# Q3932: Replay context into create_taproot_address

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with attacker-controlled the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context so `create_taproot_address` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the deposit-to-move-tx binding to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/builder/address.rs::create_taproot_address
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
