# Q2264: process_transactions program-cache staleness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_transactions` by use json-rpc `sendtransaction` from one low-rate client with serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, duplicate-signature timing, and queue pressure such that upgrade, close, or deploy timing makes this function observe a stale executor or stale deployment slot state, breaking the invariant that program cache contents must match loader-visible deployment state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs::process_transactions
- Entrypoint: use JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from one low-rate client
- Attacker controls: serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, duplicate-signature timing, and queue pressure
- Exploit idea: look for old-code/new-state or new-code/old-state combinations
- Invariant to test: program cache contents must match loader-visible deployment state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race loader upgrades or closes against repeated invocations
