# Q0105: WombatPoolHelperV2.deposit - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` while the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, and drive `this.balance(msg.sender)` out of agreement with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` - breaking the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding - for High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, snapshot `this.balance(msg.sender)` and `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`, run the attacker's `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
