# Q1869: deploy_program loaded-data undercount

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `deploy_program` by submit transactions invoking the upgradeable bpf loader without trusted authority with loader instruction sequences, duplicated accounts, programdata sizes, and boundary elf payloads such that loaded-accounts-data accounting can be made smaller than the real memory footprint or persisted delta, breaking the invariant that loaded account data size must track real loaded and committed state accurately and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/deploy.rs::deploy_program
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking the upgradeable BPF loader without trusted authority
- Attacker controls: loader instruction sequences, duplicated accounts, programdata sizes, and boundary ELF payloads
- Exploit idea: aim for account-resize and ALT-heavy transactions that undercount loaded state
- Invariant to test: loaded account data size must track real loaded and committed state accurately
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: compare loaded-accounts-data counters to actual touched and resized account bytes
