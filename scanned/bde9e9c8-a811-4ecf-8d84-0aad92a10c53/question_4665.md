# Q4665: send-underlying via transfer: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), controlling the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, drive `send-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296) — which pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296` -> `send-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Reach it through `transfer` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `send-underlying` touches, run `transfer` with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
