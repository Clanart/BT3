# Q2873: WombatBribeManager.harvestSinglePool - getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown

## Question
In wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Does `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the attacker votes in the block immediately before a known keeper cast, so that `poolInfos[lp].isActive` diverges from `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]`, the invariant that the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance is broken, and the result is Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)` (mechanism: getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the lp array, forwarded straight into WombatStaking.vote with zero deltas and caller set to address(0)
- Exploit idea: getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Precondition: the attacker votes in the block immediately before a known keeper cast.
- Invariant to test: the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance; concretely, `poolInfos[lp].isActive` must stay reconciled with `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (the lp array, forwarded straight into WombatStaking.vote with zero deltas and caller set to address(0)) under the attacker votes in the block immediately before a known keeper cast, asserting on every row that the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance.
