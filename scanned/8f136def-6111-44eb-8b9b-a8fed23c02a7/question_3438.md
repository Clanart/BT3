# Q3438: BaseRewardPoolV2.donateRewards - totalStaked and balanceOf read from different sources

## Question
In rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol, totalStaked() reads IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(operator) while balanceOf(account) reads IMasterMagpie(operator).stakingInfo(stakingToken, account), so a token sent directly to MasterMagpie, or a vlMGP-style credit made with no transfer, permanently desynchronises numerator and denominator. Starting from a state where the attacker funds the action with a flash loan of the staking token repaid in the same transaction, can an unprivileged EOA use `donateRewards(uint256 _amountReward, address _rewardToken)` to leave `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` inconsistent with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`, violating the invariant that sum over all accounts of balanceOf(account) must equal totalStaked() and extracting Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol -> `donateRewards(uint256 _amountReward, address _rewardToken)` (mechanism: totalStaked and balanceOf read from different sources)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `donateRewards(uint256 _amountReward, address _rewardToken)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountReward down to one wei and which registered reward token is provisioned
- Exploit idea: totalStaked() reads IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(operator) while balanceOf(account) reads IMasterMagpie(operator).stakingInfo(stakingToken, account), so a token sent directly to MasterMagpie, or a vlMGP-style credit made with no transfer, permanently desynchronises numerator and denominator. Precondition: the attacker funds the action with a flash loan of the staking token repaid in the same transaction.
- Invariant to test: sum over all accounts of balanceOf(account) must equal totalStaked(); concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the attacker funds the action with a flash loan of the staking token repaid in the same transaction, have the attacker run `donateRewards(uint256 _amountReward, address _rewardToken)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` versus `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
