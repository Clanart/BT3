# Q2917: BaseRewardPool.getReward - _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles

## Question
In rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol, _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` while the staking token is a low-decimal receipt token so 10**stakingDecimals() is small, and drive `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` out of agreement with `userRewardPerTokenPaid[_rewardToken][account]` - breaking the invariant that a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered - for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the timing of the claim, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Precondition: the staking token is a low-decimal receipt token so 10**stakingDecimals() is small.
- Invariant to test: a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` must stay reconciled with `userRewardPerTokenPaid[_rewardToken][account]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the staking token is a low-decimal receipt token so 10**stakingDecimals() is small, then assert `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` and `userRewardPerTokenPaid[_rewardToken][account]` end identical in both runs.
