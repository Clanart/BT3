# Q1256: Replay context into select_confirmed_tx_info

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync with attacker-controlled the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges so `select_confirmed_tx_info` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the linkage between Citrea state and a replacement deposit move transaction to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/sync.rs::select_confirmed_tx_info
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
