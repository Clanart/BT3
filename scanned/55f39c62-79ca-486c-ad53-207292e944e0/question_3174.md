# Q3174: resolve-callcode via call-ststx-ratio: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-callcode` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349` -> `resolve-callcode`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `resolve-callcode` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
