# Q3034: population via borrow: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `borrow` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
