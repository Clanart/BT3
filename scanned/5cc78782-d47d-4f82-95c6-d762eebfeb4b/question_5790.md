# Q5790: next-index via redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, can an unprivileged attacker make `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `next-index` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
