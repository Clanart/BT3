# Q1148: accrue-debt-asset via repay: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) reach `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `repay` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) varied, and assert that the value `accrue-debt-asset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
