# Q3415: NEAR relayer fast-claim coupling shared proof response reused across entrypoints via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `claim_fee` plus earlier fast-finalization path` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee_callback with fast-transfer origin ids` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `shared proof response reused across entrypoints` under uses `origin_transfer_id` to ensure that a relayer who fronted a fast transfer can only collect fee after the origin leg really finalizes with matching parameters, violating `the first leg and second leg of a fast transfer must stay tightly coupled so a relayer cannot claim against a different transfer or a different fee schedule`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee_callback with fast-transfer origin ids`
- Entrypoint: `public `claim_fee` plus earlier fast-finalization path`
- Attacker controls: fast-transfer id, origin transfer id, relayer identity, fee recipient, and settlement order across both legs
- Exploit idea: Attack systems where one verifier contract serves deploy, finalize, metadata, and fee-claim flows with a shared result type. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: the first leg and second leg of a fast transfer must stay tightly coupled so a relayer cannot claim against a different transfer or a different fee schedule
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Attempt to route accepted verifier outputs into every public proof consumer and assert that each entrypoint only accepts its intended result variant and source semantics. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
