# Q1510: NEAR resolve_utxo_fin_transfer RBF or connector semantics leave stale bridge state via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `callback after sending tokens for UTXO-to-Near settlement` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::resolve_utxo_fin_transfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `RBF or connector semantics leave stale bridge state` under interprets callback refund semantics and either removes tracked UTXO finalization state or emits the completed event, violating `UTXO resolution must not leave the same origin transfer both payable and replayable after callback edge cases`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::resolve_utxo_fin_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `callback after sending tokens for UTXO-to-Near settlement`
- Attacker controls: token id, amount, callback outcome, UTXO transfer message, origin chain, and storage owner
- Exploit idea: Target UTXO callbacks and connector withdrawal coupling where external UTXO semantics may evolve while bridge state stays fixed. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: UTXO resolution must not leave the same origin transfer both payable and replayable after callback edge cases
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Model replacement or reordered UTXO events and assert that the bridge cannot settle both the replaced and replacement economic event. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
