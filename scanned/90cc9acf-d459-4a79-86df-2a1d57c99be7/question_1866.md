# Q1866: NEAR Wormhole InitTransfer conversion proof kind or event class confusion at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Wormhole init-transfer proof flow` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/parsed_vaa.rs::TryInto<InitTransferMessage>` violate `decoded fields and derived source identity must stay bound to the intended source chain so a payload cannot be replayed across chain/address domains` in the `proof kind or event class confusion` attack class because Borsh-decodes a Wormhole payload into `InitTransferMessage` and derives the emitter address using `token_address.get_chain()` plus the VAA emitter bytes becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/parsed_vaa.rs::TryInto<InitTransferMessage>`
- Entrypoint: `public Wormhole init-transfer proof flow`
- Attacker controls: payload bytes inside a validated VAA, recipient string, token address chain, sender address, fee fields, and message
- Exploit idea: Look for outer proof envelopes that carry a kind tag separately from the payload bytes they validate. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: decoded fields and derived source identity must stay bound to the intended source chain so a payload cannot be replayed across chain/address domains
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Cross-check every proof kind against every parser and assert that no valid envelope can downcast into the wrong bridge action. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
