# Q3720: NEAR init_transfer resume path fee payout and storage refund overlap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit `yield-resume callback for a previously deferred outbound transfer` so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_resume` both refunds reserved storage and pays a fee out of the same economic event because of removes a stored promise id, retries storage transfer from the message account, and then restarts `init_transfer_internal` after a timeout or callback result, violating `resume logic must never let one deferred transfer be funded, resumed, or emitted more than once or under a different payer/value pairing`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_resume`
- Entrypoint: `yield-resume callback for a previously deferred outbound transfer`
- Attacker controls: timing of storage funding, promise completion order, storage owner, message-storage account state, and the original transfer message contents
- Exploit idea: Target callbacks that remove state and refund storage while also minting or transferring fees.
- Invariant to test: resume logic must never let one deferred transfer be funded, resumed, or emitted more than once or under a different payer/value pairing
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Model every success/failure order and assert that one event cannot produce both the intended fee and an unintended storage rebate for the attacker.
