# Q5611: WombatPoolHelperV2.deposit - depositFor hardcodes _minimumLiquidity to zero

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol: depositFor() calls _deposit(_amount, 0, _for, address(this)) with the Wombat minimum liquidity pinned to zero, so a deposit routed through it accepts any execution the pool gives, and the receipt mint is taken from whatever delta results. Under MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, is there an unprivileged sequence of `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` that leaves `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` unreconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`, violates the invariant that a deposit path must carry a slippage floor even when the beneficiary is not the caller, and delivers Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: depositFor hardcodes _minimumLiquidity to zero)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: depositFor() calls _deposit(_amount, 0, _for, address(this)) with the Wombat minimum liquidity pinned to zero, so a deposit routed through it accepts any execution the pool gives, and the receipt mint is taken from whatever delta results. Precondition: MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed.
- Invariant to test: a deposit path must carry a slippage floor even when the beneficiary is not the caller; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity) under MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, asserting on every row that a deposit path must carry a slippage floor even when the beneficiary is not the caller.
