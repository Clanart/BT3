# Q1486: process_and_record_aged_transactions batch cancel partial state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_and_record_aged_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with aged blockhashes, durable nonces, conflicting write sets, and batch scheduling order such that batch cancellation or conflict resolution can leave some side effects committed while the batch is treated as failed or retried, breaking the invariant that all-or-nothing expectations for a batch outcome must match committed state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/banking_stage/consumer.rs::process_and_record_aged_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: aged blockhashes, durable nonces, conflicting write sets, and batch scheduling order
- Exploit idea: use conflicting batched transactions to look for half-committed outcomes
- Invariant to test: all-or-nothing expectations for a batch outcome must match committed state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: submit deliberately conflicting batches and diff committed accounts against reported batch results
