# Q0587: convert-to-shares-preview via redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`convert-to-shares-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308) returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing `min-out`, use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308` -> `convert-to-shares-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-shares-preview` returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Reach it through `redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-out`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
