# Q3118: NEAR omni-types EVM receipt parser address normalization changes authenticated subject at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public EVM proof path through `verify_proof`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-types/src/evm/receipt.rs::Receipt/LogEntry` violate `receipt parsing must not let crafted receipts or logs alias one event as another bridge event class` in the `address normalization changes authenticated subject` attack class because decodes receipts and log entries before inclusion and event-class checks becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-types/src/evm/receipt.rs::Receipt/LogEntry`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM proof path through `verify_proof``
- Attacker controls: RLP-encoded receipt bytes, log arrays, log index, and ABI field boundaries
- Exploit idea: Target hex, byte-array, and account-id conversions between proof parsing and token/recipient lookup. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: receipt parsing must not let crafted receipts or logs alias one event as another bridge event class
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Round-trip every proof-derived address through all local conversions and assert that normalization never changes the bridge subject. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
