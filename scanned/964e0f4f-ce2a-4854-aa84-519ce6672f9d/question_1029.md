# Q1029: Race verify_additional_disprove_conditions across concurrent state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch, retry, or reorder public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline interactions around the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests so `verify_additional_disprove_conditions` observes inconsistent state across memory, database, and on-chain checks, breaking the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, and leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/verifier.rs::verify_additional_disprove_conditions
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests
- Exploit idea: use retries, batching, or timing around the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests to desynchronize state
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
