# Q2034: evict_using_random_selection balance prepost mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `evict_using_random_selection` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs around cache pressure with many distinct program invocations, upgrade timing, and cache-pressure friendly workloads such that balance collection or reporting can disagree with the actual state transition that commits, breaking the invariant that reported balances must match committed balances and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/loaded_programs.rs::evict_using_random_selection
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs around cache pressure
- Attacker controls: many distinct program invocations, upgrade timing, and cache-pressure friendly workloads
- Exploit idea: look for mismatches between reported and real lamport deltas
- Invariant to test: reported balances must match committed balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: compare pre/post balances returned by tracing against a direct account diff
