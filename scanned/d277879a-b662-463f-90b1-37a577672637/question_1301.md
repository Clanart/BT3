# Q1301: get-notional-evaluation via collateral-remove: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the set of assets held, drive `get-notional-evaluation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514) — which folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total — to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514` -> `get-notional-evaluation`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the set of assets held, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
