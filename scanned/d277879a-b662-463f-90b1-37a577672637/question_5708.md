# Q5708: resolve-dia via borrow: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `borrow` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `resolve-dia` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
