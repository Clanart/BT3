# Q1129: NEAR normalized amount helpers recipient or fee-recipient rebinding through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public sign/finalize/claim paths across heterogeneous decimals` with control over amount, fee, token decimals, origin decimals, destination decimals, and zero-fee versus nonzero-fee branches and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::normalize_amount/denormalize_amount` from the adjacent the next module that consumes the same asset or transfer id that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `recipient or fee-recipient rebinding` attack class because normalizes and denormalizes bridge amounts when crossing chains with different decimals and later uses those values for settlement and fee claim, violating `amount conversions must never misprice a user’s principal or fee by more than the documented dust behavior or let attackers move the rounding remainder to the wrong party`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::normalize_amount/denormalize_amount`
- Entrypoint: `public sign/finalize/claim paths across heterogeneous decimals`
- Attacker controls: amount, fee, token decimals, origin decimals, destination decimals, and zero-fee versus nonzero-fee branches
- Exploit idea: Exploit optional fee-recipient fields, fast-transfer relayer substitution, or predecessor-captured identities. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent the next module that consumes the same asset or transfer id.
- Invariant to test: amount conversions must never misprice a user’s principal or fee by more than the documented dust behavior or let attackers move the rounding remainder to the wrong party
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Build pairs of proofs/messages that vary only in recipient-oriented fields and assert that settlement, fee claim, and event emission stay bound to one tuple. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::normalize_amount/denormalize_amount` and the adjacent the next module that consumes the same asset or transfer id after every branch.
