# Q0677: ArbWomUp2.incentiveDeposit - the payout uses a raw transfer whose result is ignored

## Question
wombat/ArbWomUp2.sol: the non-bull branch calls IERC20(busd).transfer(msg.sender, rewardToSend) rather than safeTransfer, so a token that returns false leaves the claimed counter advanced with nothing delivered. With _amount, _minMGPRec and _bullMode, all caller-supplied, with the bull leg swapping the contract's own tokens under attacker control and the contract's BUSD balance is below the tier reward earned, can an unprivileged caller sequence `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minMGPRec, bool _bullMode)` so that `_minMGPRec supplied by the caller` and `the MGP actually received by the swap` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a token transfer on a payout path must be checked and realising High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/ArbWomUp2.sol -> `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minMGPRec, bool _bullMode)` (mechanism: the payout uses a raw transfer whose result is ignored)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minMGPRec, bool _bullMode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, _minMGPRec and _bullMode, all caller-supplied, with the bull leg swapping the contract's own tokens
- Exploit idea: the non-bull branch calls IERC20(busd).transfer(msg.sender, rewardToSend) rather than safeTransfer, so a token that returns false leaves the claimed counter advanced with nothing delivered. Precondition: the contract's BUSD balance is below the tier reward earned.
- Invariant to test: a token transfer on a payout path must be checked; concretely, `_minMGPRec supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the MGP actually received by the swap`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minMGPRec, bool _bullMode)` sequence atomically under the contract's BUSD balance is below the tier reward earned, asserting at the end that `_minMGPRec supplied by the caller` still equals `the MGP actually received by the swap` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
