# Q1840: neg collapse distinct inputs into one accepted state via unhardened derivation indexes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit aggregate signature material targeting `neg` in `crates/chia-bls/src/signature.rs` with unhardened derivation indexes when the payload is accepted by one public API before another validates it make chia_rs collapse distinct inputs into one accepted state, violating the invariant that domain-separated signed messages cannot be replayed, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-bls/src/signature.rs:195` / `neg`
- Entrypoint: submit aggregate signature material
- Attacker controls: unhardened derivation indexes
- Exploit idea: Drive `neg` through its public caller path using unhardened derivation indexes; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: domain-separated signed messages cannot be replayed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data
- Fast validation: construct aggregate signature vectors with duplicates, infinity, and swapped messages.
