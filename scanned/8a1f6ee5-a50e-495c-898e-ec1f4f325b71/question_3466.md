# Q3466: load_session: A domain containing `_` that confuses the `offline_(.*)` regex ...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the derived `session_id` string (offline_<domain> or <...>_<user_id>) shaped by the token/shop the attacker supplies) reach `load_session / delete_session / store_session` in lib/shopify_app/session/session_repository.rb via any authenticated flow that calls SessionRepository.load_session(session_id), supplying a domain containing `_` that confuses the `offline_(.*)` regex vs the `split('_')` user branch, so that session-id parsing must map to exactly the shop/user the verified token proves, with no cross-tenant collision is violated, leading to cross-shop / cross-user session load or deletion (unauthorized access / integrity loss)? Specifically confirm that a wrong-secret or tampered artifact is always rejected before any side effect.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/session/session_repository.rb — `load_session / delete_session / store_session`
- Entrypoint: any authenticated flow that calls SessionRepository.load_session(session_id)
- Attacker controls: the derived `session_id` string (offline_<domain> or <...>_<user_id>) shaped by the token/shop the attacker supplies — specifically a domain containing `_` that confuses the `offline_(.*)` regex vs the `split('_')` user branch.
- Exploit idea: Run the exact flow with a deliberately-wrong secret/signature/token to prove verification actually rejects it.
- Invariant to test: session-id parsing must map to exactly the shop/user the verified token proves, with no cross-tenant collision
- Expected Immunefi impact: cross-shop / cross-user session load or deletion (unauthorized access / integrity loss) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: negative-control test asserting a wrong-secret/wrong-signature/tampered-token request is rejected with no side effect.
