# Q2934: calc-liq-debt-repay via liquidate-redeem: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the borrower targeted, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liq-debt-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `calc-liq-debt-repay` takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay` takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the borrower targeted across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-liq-debt-repay` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
