# Q1320: find-and-resolve-asset-value via liquidate: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `borrower`, any third-party principal reach `find-and-resolve-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668` -> `find-and-resolve-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `find-and-resolve-asset-value` reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found. Reach it through `liquidate` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `borrower`, any third-party principal across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `find-and-resolve-asset-value` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
