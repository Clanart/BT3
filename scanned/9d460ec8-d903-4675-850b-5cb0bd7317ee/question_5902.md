# Q5902: MasterMagpie.updatePool - lpSupply inflation by direct token donation

## Question
In rewards/MasterMagpie.sol, _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Starting from a state where the victim is mid-cooldown in VLMGP so getRewardablePercentWAD is still 1e18, can an unprivileged EOA use `updatePool(address _stakingToken)` to leave `totalAllocPoint` inconsistent with `tokenToPoolInfo[_stakingToken].allocPoint`, violating the invariant that MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply and extracting High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `updatePool(address _stakingToken)` (mechanism: lpSupply inflation by direct token donation)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `updatePool(address _stakingToken)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _stakingToken and the timestamp at which accMGPPerShare is rolled forward
- Exploit idea: _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Precondition: the victim is mid-cooldown in VLMGP so getRewardablePercentWAD is still 1e18.
- Invariant to test: MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply; concretely, `totalAllocPoint` must stay reconciled with `tokenToPoolInfo[_stakingToken].allocPoint`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `updatePool(address _stakingToken)` sequence atomically under the victim is mid-cooldown in VLMGP so getRewardablePercentWAD is still 1e18, asserting at the end that `totalAllocPoint` still equals `tokenToPoolInfo[_stakingToken].allocPoint` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
