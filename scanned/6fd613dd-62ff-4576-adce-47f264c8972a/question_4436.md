# Q4436: check-confidence via collateral-remove-redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem reach `check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem varied, and assert that the value `check-confidence` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
