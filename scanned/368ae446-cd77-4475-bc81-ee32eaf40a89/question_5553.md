# Q5553: WombatPoolHelperV2.withdraw - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, is there an unprivileged sequence of `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` that leaves `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` unreconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, violates the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity and _minAmount
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, call `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`, and assert `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` equals `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
