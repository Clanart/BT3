# Q4630: iter-lookup-debt via liquidate-multi: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), can an unprivileged attacker make `iter-lookup-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218` -> `iter-lookup-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
