# Q3418: debt-remove-scaled via liquidate-redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
