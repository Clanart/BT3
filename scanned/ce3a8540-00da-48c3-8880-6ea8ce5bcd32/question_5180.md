# Q5180: WombatStaking.deposit - harvest reverts on a manipulated smart convert and blocks deposits and withdrawals

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatStaking.sol, where SmartWomConvert.smartConvert passes _minRec equal to _amountIn, so a manipulated pool makes it revert, and because _sendRewards runs inside _toMasterWomAndSendReward it is on the path of every deposit, depositLP and withdraw for that pool. Assuming a large honest deposit is pending in the mempool for the same pool, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `IERC20(poolInfo.lpAddress).balanceOf(address(this))` and `lpReceived credited by IMintableERC20(receiptToken).mint` via `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper`, breaking the invariant that a manipulable external price must not be able to block principal deposits and withdrawals and producing High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatStaking.sol -> `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper` (mechanism: harvest reverts on a manipulated smart convert and blocks deposits and withdrawals)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, _minimumLiquidity and _for, forwarded verbatim by WombatPoolHelper/V2/AnkrBNBPoolHelper
- Exploit idea: SmartWomConvert.smartConvert passes _minRec equal to _amountIn, so a manipulated pool makes it revert, and because _sendRewards runs inside _toMasterWomAndSendReward it is on the path of every deposit, depositLP and withdraw for that pool. Precondition: a large honest deposit is pending in the mempool for the same pool.
- Invariant to test: a manipulable external price must not be able to block principal deposits and withdrawals; concretely, `IERC20(poolInfo.lpAddress).balanceOf(address(this))` must stay reconciled with `lpReceived credited by IMintableERC20(receiptToken).mint`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount, _minimumLiquidity and _for, forwarded verbatim by WombatPoolHelper/V2/AnkrBNBPoolHelper) under a large honest deposit is pending in the mempool for the same pool, asserting on every row that a manipulable external price must not be able to block principal deposits and withdrawals.
