# Q1303: transfer artifact memory blowup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `transfer` by submit transactions invoking the system program with lamport amounts, duplicated accounts, seeded addresses, and multi-instruction ordering such that logs, return data, inner instructions, or side-channel artifacts created downstream scale much faster than request size, breaking the invariant that execution artifact growth must stay bounded per transaction and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::transfer
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking the system program
- Attacker controls: lamport amounts, duplicated accounts, seeded addresses, and multi-instruction ordering
- Exploit idea: use legal execution artifacts as the amplifier instead of raw packet size
- Invariant to test: execution artifact growth must stay bounded per transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: run the same heavy transaction repeatedly and correlate artifact size with resident memory
