# Q1869: Leave reusable partial state in process_with_ctx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker force a partial failure around the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit` and then resume public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `process_with_ctx` continues from stale intermediate state, causing the nofn aggregate key and covenant context to diverge from the canonical bridge context and breaking the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/states/mod.rs::process_with_ctx
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit`
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure around the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit` and then resume under changed state
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
