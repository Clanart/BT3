# Q2658: read_only_accounts_cache.store read-only cache incoherence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that cause cache population for large accounts with repeated reads of large or frequently changing accounts so that read-only caching can return a version that writable/runtime paths would reject as stale, breaking the invariant that read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs::store
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that cause cache population for large accounts
- Attacker controls: repeated reads of large or frequently changing accounts
- Exploit idea: diff read-only and runtime-visible answers for the same account
- Invariant to test: read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare read-only cache results to direct runtime/bank reads after writes
