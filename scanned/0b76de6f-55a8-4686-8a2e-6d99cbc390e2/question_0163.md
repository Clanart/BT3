# Q0163: vault-accrue via redeem: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing `recipient`, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `redeem` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `redeem` with `recipient`, then read `vault-accrue` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
