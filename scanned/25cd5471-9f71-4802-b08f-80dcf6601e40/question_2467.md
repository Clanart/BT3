# Q2467: NEAR verify_proof wrapper parser boundary or offset manipulation at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `internal proof-dispatch helper reached from public `fin_transfer`, `claim_fee`, `deploy_token`, and `bind_token`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::verify_proof` violate `every proof-consuming public flow must stay bound to the intended prover, source chain, and proof kind so attackers cannot cross-wire verifier domains` in the `parser boundary or offset manipulation` attack class because routes proof bytes to the chain-specific prover stored in `provers` and returns the promise used by higher-level bridge flows becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::verify_proof`
- Entrypoint: `internal proof-dispatch helper reached from public `fin_transfer`, `claim_fee`, `deploy_token`, and `bind_token``
- Attacker controls: chain kind, prover args bytes, and the choice of configured prover contract
- Exploit idea: Attack offset arithmetic, length prefixes, bucket indices, or body slicing in proof decoders. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: every proof-consuming public flow must stay bound to the intended prover, source chain, and proof kind so attackers cannot cross-wire verifier domains
- Expected Immunefi impact: Light client verification bypass
- Fast validation: Fuzz minimal, maximal, and malformed lengths and assert that every accepted proof round-trips into exactly the intended structured fields. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
