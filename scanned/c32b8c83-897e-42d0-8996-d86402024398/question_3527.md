# Q3527: sanitized_params: A Referer whose query holds a hostile `shop` used by `referer_s...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`shop`, the Referer header, `embedded`, Sec-Fetch-Dest header, and POST vs GET body) reach `sanitized_params / referer_sanitized_shop_name / embedded?` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/sanitized_params.rb via any controller reading params through the SanitizedParams concern, supplying a Referer whose query holds a hostile `shop` used by `referer_sanitized_shop_name` when the direct param is absent, so that a non-string or referer-sourced shop must still be sanitized before any trust decision is violated, leading to cross-shop access / open redirect from an unsanitized shop value? Specifically confirm that no protected state is reachable by skipping or repeating an auth step.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/sanitized_params.rb — `sanitized_params / referer_sanitized_shop_name / embedded?`
- Entrypoint: any controller reading params through the SanitizedParams concern
- Attacker controls: `shop`, the Referer header, `embedded`, Sec-Fetch-Dest header, and POST vs GET body — specifically a Referer whose query holds a hostile `shop` used by `referer_sanitized_shop_name` when the direct param is absent.
- Exploit idea: Walk the auth state machine out of order (skip/repeat a step) and confirm no step can be reached unauthenticated.
- Invariant to test: a non-string or referer-sourced shop must still be sanitized before any trust decision
- Expected Immunefi impact: cross-shop access / open redirect from an unsanitized shop value (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: state-machine test exercising out-of-order transitions and asserting each protected state still requires verification.
