# Q3107: Solana InitTransfer::process native fee and token fee drawn from wrong asset bucket at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public outbound flow through `init_transfer`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/init_transfer.rs::process` violate `the posted payload must remain exactly backed by the consumed token or SOL value regardless of which branch executes` in the `native fee and token fee drawn from wrong asset bucket` attack class because routes an outbound transfer through native-vault custody or bridged-burn semantics and posts the serialized message to Wormhole/Near becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/init_transfer.rs::process`
- Entrypoint: `public outbound flow through `init_transfer``
- Attacker controls: mint/vault branch choice, user signer, token account contents, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, and message
- Exploit idea: Focus on branches that mint native-fee tokens, transfer escrowed tokens, or unwrap wrapped native assets. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: the posted payload must remain exactly backed by the consumed token or SOL value regardless of which branch executes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Trace fee asset origin across every branch and assert that each fee component comes from the asset pool the bridge actually consumed. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
