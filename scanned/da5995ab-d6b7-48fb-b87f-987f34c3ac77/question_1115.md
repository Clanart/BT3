# Q1115: hmac_valid?: A very large body to see whether verification is skipped or tru...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the raw request body, the X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header) reach `hmac_valid? / shopify_hmac` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/payload_verification.rb via POST /webhooks/:type (WebhooksController) and the extension verification controller, supplying a very large body to see whether verification is skipped or truncated before `secure_compare`, so that a missing or malformed HMAC header must fail closed is violated, leading to authentication bypass on the webhook endpoint? Specifically confirm that the security property holds for the whole generated input class, not just one example.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/payload_verification.rb — `hmac_valid? / shopify_hmac`
- Entrypoint: POST /webhooks/:type (WebhooksController) and the extension verification controller
- Attacker controls: the raw request body, the X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header — specifically a very large body to see whether verification is skipped or truncated before `secure_compare`.
- Exploit idea: State the security property as an invariant and check it over a generated range of related inputs.
- Invariant to test: a missing or malformed HMAC header must fail closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: authentication bypass on the webhook endpoint (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: invariant/property test over generated inputs asserting the security property holds universally.
