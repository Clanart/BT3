# Q5547: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, where WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Assuming the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, breaking the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding and producing High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool) under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, asserting on every row that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding.
