# Q255: Accept wrong proof/network context in total_work_from_wt_tx_test_util

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height through broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation so `total_work_from_wt_tx_test_util` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/utils.rs::total_work_from_wt_tx_test_util
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
