# Q1347: Keeper.Simulate - Block State Calls Leak Committed Changes Across Simulated Transactions

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker send public JSON-RPC or gRPC call, estimate, simulate, or trace requests through `public eth_simulateV1-style simulation request` while controlling `authorizationList` and `block number/hash`, under the precondition that the caller supplies state overrides or authorizationList, drive `SetTxDefaults -> EstimateGas/EthCall -> ToTransaction -> signed raw submission` in `x/evm/keeper/simulate.go::Keeper.Simulate` so that block state calls leak committed changes across simulated transactions, violating the invariant that RPC defaults must match the transaction that is eventually signed or submitted, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/simulate.go::Keeper.Simulate`
- Entrypoint: `public eth_simulateV1-style simulation request`
- Attacker controls: `authorizationList`, `block number/hash`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: block state calls leak committed changes across simulated transactions through `SetTxDefaults -> EstimateGas/EthCall -> ToTransaction -> signed raw submission`.
- Invariant to test: RPC defaults must match the transaction that is eventually signed or submitted.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: run a local integration test that submits the crafted raw tx through JSON-RPC and compares committed state with direct keeper queries.
