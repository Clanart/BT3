# Q3453: oracle-price-legal via collateral-add: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling call ordering within the block, drive `oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) — which accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band — to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `collateral-add` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `oracle-price-legal` touches, run `collateral-add` with call ordering within the block, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
