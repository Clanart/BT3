# Q2272: Solana signed-payload serialization one inbound event spawns multiple outbound obligations via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Solana deploy/init/finalize instructions` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/* plus instruction callers` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `one inbound event spawns multiple outbound obligations` under serializes deploy, init, and finalize payloads into the bytes that Near later verifies and interprets, violating `serialized payloads must match Near’s decoding byte-for-byte so one Solana event cannot be verified as a different Near-side bridge action`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/* plus instruction callers`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana deploy/init/finalize instructions`
- Attacker controls: all payload fields that are serialized for Near and signed by the derived bridge key
- Exploit idea: Focus on forward-to-other-chain branches and fast-transfer substitution where an inbound event becomes a new pending transfer. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: serialized payloads must match Near’s decoding byte-for-byte so one Solana event cannot be verified as a different Near-side bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Track value and replay state across both the inbound leg and the forwarded leg and assert that one source event cannot increase total outstanding claims. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
