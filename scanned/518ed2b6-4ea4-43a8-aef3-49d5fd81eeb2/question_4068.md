# Q4068: resolve-or-create via supply-collateral-add: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) reach `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `resolve-or-create` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
