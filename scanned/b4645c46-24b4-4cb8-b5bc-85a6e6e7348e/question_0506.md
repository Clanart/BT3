# Q0506: SmartWomConvert.smartConvert - buyback swap executes with a hardcoded zero minimum

## Question
In wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol, _convertFor() calls IWombatRouter(router).swapExactTokensForTokens(tokenPath, poolPath, buybackAmount, 0, address(this), block.timestamp) with the minimum output pinned to zero, so the swap leg itself has no slippage floor. Starting from a state where the attacker has pushed mWom below buybackThreshold against wom in the same transaction, can an unprivileged EOA use `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` to leave `amountRec from swapExactTokensForTokens` inconsistent with `convertAmount minted 1:1 by IMWom(mWom).deposit`, violating the invariant that every swap of protocol or user value must carry a caller-independent slippage floor and extracting Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol -> `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: buyback swap executes with a hardcoded zero minimum)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountIn and _mode, plus the pool state that currentRatio and maxSwapAmount are read from
- Exploit idea: _convertFor() calls IWombatRouter(router).swapExactTokensForTokens(tokenPath, poolPath, buybackAmount, 0, address(this), block.timestamp) with the minimum output pinned to zero, so the swap leg itself has no slippage floor. Precondition: the attacker has pushed mWom below buybackThreshold against wom in the same transaction.
- Invariant to test: every swap of protocol or user value must carry a caller-independent slippage floor; concretely, `amountRec from swapExactTokensForTokens` must stay reconciled with `convertAmount minted 1:1 by IMWom(mWom).deposit`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the attacker has pushed mWom below buybackThreshold against wom in the same transaction, call `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)`, and assert `amountRec from swapExactTokensForTokens` equals `convertAmount minted 1:1 by IMWom(mWom).deposit` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
