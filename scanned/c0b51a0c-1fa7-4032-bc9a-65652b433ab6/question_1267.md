# Q1267: Exploit replacement logic in list_rbf_txids_for_id

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the ordering of repeated enqueue / replace / cancel requests so `list_rbf_txids_for_id` constructs a replacement path that copies the wrong witnesses, inputs, or fee logic, corrupting the finalized/seen-at-height status recorded for the send request and violating the invariant that queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/db/tx_sender.rs::list_rbf_txids_for_id
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the ordering of repeated enqueue / replace / cancel requests
- Exploit idea: copy the wrong witnesses, inputs, or fee logic by shaping the ordering of repeated enqueue / replace / cancel requests
- Invariant to test: queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
