# Q1433: Leave reusable partial state in aggregator_double_deposit

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker force a partial failure around the `deposit_outpoint` and its on-chain prevout details and then resume public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `aggregator_double_deposit` continues from stale intermediate state, causing the emergency-stop transaction that should protect the same deposit to diverge from the canonical bridge context and breaking the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/rpc/aggregator.rs::aggregator_double_deposit
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `deposit_outpoint` and its on-chain prevout details
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure around the `deposit_outpoint` and its on-chain prevout details and then resume under changed state
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
