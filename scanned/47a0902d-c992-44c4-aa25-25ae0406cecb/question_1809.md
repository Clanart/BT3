# Q1809: modify_memory_region_of_account loaded-data undercount

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `modify_memory_region_of_account` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with account layouts, duplicate writable aliases, realloc paths, and nested cpi writes such that loaded-accounts-data accounting can be made smaller than the real memory footprint or persisted delta, breaking the invariant that loaded account data size must track real loaded and committed state accurately and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/serialization.rs::modify_memory_region_of_account
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: account layouts, duplicate writable aliases, realloc paths, and nested CPI writes
- Exploit idea: aim for account-resize and ALT-heavy transactions that undercount loaded state
- Invariant to test: loaded account data size must track real loaded and committed state accurately
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: compare loaded-accounts-data counters to actual touched and resized account bytes
