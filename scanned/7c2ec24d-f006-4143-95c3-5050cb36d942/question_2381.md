# Q2381: clean_accounts same-pubkey churn hotspot

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `clean_accounts` by submit transactions that create, drain, resize, and recreate many accounts with high-churn account creation/close patterns and repeated zero-lamport transitions so that rewriting one pubkey repeatedly creates pathological behavior that normal multi-pubkey load does not, breaking the invariant that hot-key churn should not create correctness or performance pathologies and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::clean_accounts
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that create, drain, resize, and recreate many accounts
- Attacker controls: high-churn account creation/close patterns and repeated zero-lamport transitions
- Exploit idea: use hot-key churn rather than broad fanout
- Invariant to test: hot-key churn should not create correctness or performance pathologies
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: compare same-pubkey rewrite churn against equally large multi-pubkey churn
