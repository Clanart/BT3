# Q2130: spawn_stake_weighted_qos_server fee-payer unlock split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `spawn_stake_weighted_qos_server` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one client with connection counts, packet pacing, payload sizes, and unstaked-versus-staked looking client identities such that fee-payer lock or unlock handling may diverge from the accounts actually charged later, breaking the invariant that fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/quic.rs::spawn_stake_weighted_qos_server
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one client
- Attacker controls: connection counts, packet pacing, payload sizes, and unstaked-versus-staked looking client identities
- Exploit idea: try to free or relock the fee payer at the wrong moment
- Invariant to test: fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace fee-payer lock state across retries, conflicts, and partial failures
