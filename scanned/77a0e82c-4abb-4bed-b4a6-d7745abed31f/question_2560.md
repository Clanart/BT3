# Q2560: modify_accounts slot-removal liveness bug

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `modify_accounts` by submit transactions that update many related accounts in one bank with many writable accounts, cpi-heavy writes, and same-pubkey alias churn so that slot-removal logic can discard account data still needed by later state resolution, breaking the invariant that slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::modify_accounts
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that update many related accounts in one bank
- Attacker controls: many writable accounts, CPI-heavy writes, and same-pubkey alias churn
- Exploit idea: target old/new slot overlap for the same pubkey
- Invariant to test: slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn one pubkey across removable and non-removable slots
