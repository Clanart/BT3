# Q3055: Corrupt work or canonical ordering in prove_a_block_from_database

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context so `prove_a_block_from_database` computes or compares work / ordering incorrectly, causing the wrong canonical chain or watchtower result to win, corrupting the storage-proof key/value binding used for deposit or withdrawal validation and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/header_chain_prover.rs::prove_a_block_from_database
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: make the wrong chain or watchtower result win by shaping multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
