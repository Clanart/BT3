# Q2365: TxListenerDecorator.AnteHandle - Listener Side Effects Survive Rejected Transaction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit, replace, reorder, or batch pending transactions through `ante listener around public tx processing` while controlling `broadcast fallback` and `raw tx bytes`, under the precondition that the tx contains multiple messages but one extracted signer, drive `PendingTransactions -> replacement/resubmission -> CheckTx locked admission -> proposal inclusion` in `evmd/ante/tx_listener.go::TxListenerDecorator.AnteHandle` so that listener side effects survive rejected transaction, violating the invariant that fallback broadcast must not bypass signature or fee checks, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `evmd/ante/tx_listener.go::TxListenerDecorator.AnteHandle`
- Entrypoint: `ante listener around public tx processing`
- Attacker controls: `broadcast fallback`, `raw tx bytes`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: listener side effects survive rejected transaction through `PendingTransactions -> replacement/resubmission -> CheckTx locked admission -> proposal inclusion`.
- Invariant to test: fallback broadcast must not bypass signature or fee checks.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: compare IndexBlock/GetTransactionReceipt/GetBlockReceipts output against direct block/result reconstruction for the same transaction.
