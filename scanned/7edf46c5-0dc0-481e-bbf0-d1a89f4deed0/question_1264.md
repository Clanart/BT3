# Q1264: Exploit replacement logic in send_cpfp_tx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the `rbf_signing_info` object so `send_cpfp_tx` constructs a replacement path that copies the wrong witnesses, inputs, or fee logic, corrupting the cancel/activate dependency graph persisted in the database and violating the invariant that RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/cpfp.rs::send_cpfp_tx
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `rbf_signing_info` object
- Exploit idea: copy the wrong witnesses, inputs, or fee logic by shaping the `rbf_signing_info` object
- Invariant to test: RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
