# Q2076: get_connection_stake nonce replay window

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `get_connection_stake` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one unstaked client with connection identifiers, certificate/pubkey choices, source-ip reuse, and connection churn timing such that durable nonce or recent-blockhash state can be observed one way here and a different way later in the same submission lifecycle, breaking the invariant that nonce and blockhash freshness checks must be stable across the full processing pipeline and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/nonblocking/quic.rs::get_connection_stake
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one unstaked client
- Attacker controls: connection identifiers, certificate/pubkey choices, source-IP reuse, and connection churn timing
- Exploit idea: find a same-slot or retry-driven way to reuse a nonce or stale blockhash window
- Invariant to test: nonce and blockhash freshness checks must be stable across the full processing pipeline
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: replay durable-nonce and edge-age blockhash transactions across retries and batches
