# Q3688: Break reimbursement recoverability in insert_signed_emergency_stop_tx_if_not_exists

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with crafted the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering so `insert_signed_emergency_stop_tx_if_not_exists` moves the protocol past the point where reimbursement should remain recoverable, leaving the emergency-stop transaction that should protect the same deposit inconsistent with the assumption that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, and leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/aggregator.rs::insert_signed_emergency_stop_tx_if_not_exists
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering
- Exploit idea: move bridge state forward while reimbursement/slashability stays tied to older state
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
