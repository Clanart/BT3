# Q3519: Drive state split inside get_chain_state_from_height

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation with crafted the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering so `get_chain_state_from_height` updates one canonical value while another subsystem retains the older one for the same event, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/header_chain_prover.rs::get_chain_state_from_height
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Exploit idea: update one canonical value while another subsystem keeps the old one for the same event via the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
