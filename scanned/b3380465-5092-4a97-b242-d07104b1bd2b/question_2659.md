# Q2659: total-supply-preview via transfer: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
`total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, use that to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, violating the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `transfer` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `transfer` with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, then read `total-supply-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
