# Q5039: resolve-interpolation-points via deposit: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `deposit` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `deposit` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
