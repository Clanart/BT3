# Q4708: WombatPoolHelperV2.depositLP - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` while an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, and drive `this.balance(msg.sender)` out of agreement with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` - breaking the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard - for Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, snapshot `this.balance(msg.sender)` and `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`, run the attacker's `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
