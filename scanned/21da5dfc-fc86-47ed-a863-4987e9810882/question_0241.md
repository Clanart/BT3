# Q0241: WomUp.withdraw - no reentrancy guard on any balance-mutating function

## Question
Consider wombat/WomUp.sol, where stake, withdraw, migrate and getReward all carry only the updateReward modifier, with no nonReentrant, while performing external token transfers, deposits and lock calls. Assuming the attacker is the only staker for a single block, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `lastUpdateTime` and `periodFinish` via `withdraw(uint256 amount, bool claim)`, breaking the invariant that every function that mutates the stake ledger must share one reentrancy domain and producing Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WomUp.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 amount, bool claim)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard on any balance-mutating function)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 amount, bool claim)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: amount and whether the claim leg runs in the same call
- Exploit idea: stake, withdraw, migrate and getReward all carry only the updateReward modifier, with no nonReentrant, while performing external token transfers, deposits and lock calls. Precondition: the attacker is the only staker for a single block.
- Invariant to test: every function that mutates the stake ledger must share one reentrancy domain; concretely, `lastUpdateTime` must stay reconciled with `periodFinish`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `withdraw(uint256 amount, bool claim)` sequence atomically under the attacker is the only staker for a single block, asserting at the end that `lastUpdateTime` still equals `periodFinish` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
