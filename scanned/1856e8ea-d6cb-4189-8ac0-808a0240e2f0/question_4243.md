# Q4243: calc-principal-ratio-reduction via redeem: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
`calc-principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191) reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing `min-out`, use that to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191` -> `calc-principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Reach it through `redeem` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `redeem` with `min-out`, then read `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
