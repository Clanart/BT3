# Q3709: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.depositLP - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
In wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Does `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, so that `this.balance(msg.sender)` diverges from `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`, the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding is broken, and the result is High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` sequence atomically under the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, asserting at the end that `this.balance(msg.sender)` still equals `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
