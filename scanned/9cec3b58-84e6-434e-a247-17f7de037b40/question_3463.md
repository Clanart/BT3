# Q3463: WombatPoolHelper.depositLP - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Starting from a state where a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, can an unprivileged EOA use `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` to leave `pid cached at construction` inconsistent with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, violating the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value and extracting Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller) under a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, asserting on every row that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value.
