# Q5683: find-collateral-amount via liquidate: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `liquidate` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, then read `find-collateral-amount` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
