# Q5472: vault-accrue via call-ststx-ratio: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched reach `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `vault-accrue` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
