# Q0530: convert-to-scaled-debt via liquidate-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the redemption receiver varied, and assert that the value `convert-to-scaled-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
