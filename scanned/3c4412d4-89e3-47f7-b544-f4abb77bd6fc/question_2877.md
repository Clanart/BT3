# Q2877: Solana finalize response serialization endianness mismatch forks authenticated bytes via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public finalize instructions through `FinalizeTransfer::process`` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/finalize_transfer.rs` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `endianness mismatch forks authenticated bytes` under serializes a finalize response that Near later uses for fee claims and replay coupling, violating `response serialization must not let Near interpret a finalized Solana event under a different transfer id, amount, or fee recipient than Solana actually executed`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/finalize_transfer.rs`
- Entrypoint: `public finalize instructions through `FinalizeTransfer::process``
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, token mint, amount, fee recipient, and transfer id returned toward Near
- Exploit idea: Target Borsh helpers and hand-built payload encoders across Rust, Solidity, and Cairo. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: response serialization must not let Near interpret a finalized Solana event under a different transfer id, amount, or fee recipient than Solana actually executed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Cross-generate payloads on every implementation and assert byte-for-byte equality for every field combination that can reach signatures or proofs. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
