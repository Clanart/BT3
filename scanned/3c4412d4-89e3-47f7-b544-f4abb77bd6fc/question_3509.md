# Q3509: Solana finalize_transfer shared proof response reused across entrypoints through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public Solana `finalize_transfer` instruction` with control over signed payload bytes, destination nonce, mint account, recipient account, vault existence, payer funding, and account ordering and desynchronize `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::finalize_transfer` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `shared proof response reused across entrypoints` attack class because verifies the NEAR-derived signature, uses `UsedNonces::use_nonce`, then either transfers from the native vault or mints bridged supply and posts a completion message back to Near, violating `a signed inbound transfer must settle exactly once to one mint/recipient pair and must not switch between native-vault and bridged-mint branches`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::finalize_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `finalize_transfer` instruction`
- Attacker controls: signed payload bytes, destination nonce, mint account, recipient account, vault existence, payer funding, and account ordering
- Exploit idea: Attack systems where one verifier contract serves deploy, finalize, metadata, and fee-claim flows with a shared result type. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: a signed inbound transfer must settle exactly once to one mint/recipient pair and must not switch between native-vault and bridged-mint branches
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Attempt to route accepted verifier outputs into every public proof consumer and assert that each entrypoint only accepts its intended result variant and source semantics. Also assert cross-module consistency between `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::finalize_transfer` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
