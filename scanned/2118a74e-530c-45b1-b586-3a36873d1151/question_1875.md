# Q1875: Leave reusable partial state in process_and_add_new_states_from_height

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker force a partial failure around the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit` and then resume public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `process_and_add_new_states_from_height` continues from stale intermediate state, causing the reimbursement path that must remain slashable and recoverable to diverge from the canonical bridge context and breaking the invariant that partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/states/mod.rs::process_and_add_new_states_from_height
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit`
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure around the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit` and then resume under changed state
- Invariant to test: partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
