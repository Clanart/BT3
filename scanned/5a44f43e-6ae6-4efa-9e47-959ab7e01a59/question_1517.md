# Q1517: check_fee_payer_unlocked status visibility race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `check_fee_payer_unlocked` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with fee-payer aliases, duplicate accounts, rent edge cases, and batch ordering such that signature or execution status may become externally visible before the underlying state is durably consistent, breaking the invariant that externally visible status must track durable runtime state transitions and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/banking_stage/consumer.rs::check_fee_payer_unlocked
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: fee-payer aliases, duplicate accounts, rent edge cases, and batch ordering
- Exploit idea: surface an impossible early success/failure state
- Invariant to test: externally visible status must track durable runtime state transitions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare status-cache visibility to actual commit points under repeated retries
