# Q766: prepare_entry_batch batch cancel partial state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `prepare_entry_batch` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transaction ordering, duplicated accounts, address lookup tables, and batched conflicting write sets such that batch cancellation or conflict resolution can leave some side effects committed while the batch is treated as failed or retried, breaking the invariant that all-or-nothing expectations for a batch outcome must match committed state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::prepare_entry_batch
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transaction ordering, duplicated accounts, address lookup tables, and batched conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: use conflicting batched transactions to look for half-committed outcomes
- Invariant to test: all-or-nothing expectations for a batch outcome must match committed state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: submit deliberately conflicting batches and diff committed accounts against reported batch results
