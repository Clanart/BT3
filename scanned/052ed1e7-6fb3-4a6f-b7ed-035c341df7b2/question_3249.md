# Q3249: MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec - lpSupply inflation by direct token donation

## Question
In rewards/MasterMagpie.sol, _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Starting from a state where a large honest deposit is sitting in the mempool and the attacker sandwiches it, can an unprivileged EOA use `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)` to leave `IBaseRewardPool(rewarder).balanceOf(user)` inconsistent with `IBaseRewardPool(rewarder).totalStaked()`, violating the invariant that MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply and extracting High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: lpSupply inflation by direct token donation)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: both outer and inner arrays, so every reward-token address and its order
- Exploit idea: _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Precondition: a large honest deposit is sitting in the mempool and the attacker sandwiches it.
- Invariant to test: MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply; concretely, `IBaseRewardPool(rewarder).balanceOf(user)` must stay reconciled with `IBaseRewardPool(rewarder).totalStaked()`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under a large honest deposit is sitting in the mempool and the attacker sandwiches it, then assert `IBaseRewardPool(rewarder).balanceOf(user)` and `IBaseRewardPool(rewarder).totalStaked()` end identical in both runs.
