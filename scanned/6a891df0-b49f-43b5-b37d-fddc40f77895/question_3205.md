# Q3205: add-user-scaled-debt via liquidate-multi: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the trait principals supplied per entry, drive `add-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237) — which adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237` -> `add-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, then read `add-user-scaled-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
