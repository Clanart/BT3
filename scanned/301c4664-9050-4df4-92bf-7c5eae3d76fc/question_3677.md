# Q3677: NEAR message-account funding helper storage quote underestimates live state at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public init-transfer and resume flows through message-storage payment` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::try_to_transfer_balance_from_message_account` violate `message-account funding must not be spoofable or replayable in a way that funds one transfer while authorizing another` in the `storage quote underestimates live state` attack class because moves NEAR from a calculated message account into a storage owner account before outbound transfer state is finalized becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::try_to_transfer_balance_from_message_account`
- Entrypoint: `public init-transfer and resume flows through message-storage payment`
- Attacker controls: message-storage account id, signer id, required storage, native fee, and transfer timing
- Exploit idea: Target helper functions that quote storage for pending transfers, finalization records, fast transfers, binds, or deployments. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: message-account funding must not be spoofable or replayable in a way that funds one transfer while authorizing another
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Measure storage usage across maximal inputs and assert that quoted requirements always exceed or equal the true post-state footprint. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
