# Q258: Starknet deploy_token canonical token identity collision via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Starknet deploy-token entrypoint` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `canonical token identity collision` under checks pause flags, verifies a Borsh payload signature, hashes the token id, computes a deploy salt, deploys a bridge token, and writes bidirectional mappings, violating `one signed metadata payload must deploy exactly one bridge token with one stable token-id mapping and decimal model`?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet deploy-token entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: signature fields, token id `ByteArray`, name, symbol, decimals, and current class hash
- Exploit idea: Target hashed token ids, deterministic synthetic addresses, PDA seeds, and address-to-token maps. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: one signed metadata payload must deploy exactly one bridge token with one stable token-id mapping and decimal model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Search for collisions and alias conditions and assert that two distinct remote assets cannot share one local token identity or mapping row. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
