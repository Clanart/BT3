# Q2551: modify_accounts root-flush visibility gap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `modify_accounts` by submit transactions that update many related accounts in one bank with many writable accounts, cpi-heavy writes, and same-pubkey alias churn so that root advancement and flush state can diverge long enough for readers to observe impossible account histories, breaking the invariant that root visibility and flushed persistence must not diverge in externally observable ways and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::modify_accounts
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that update many related accounts in one bank
- Attacker controls: many writable accounts, CPI-heavy writes, and same-pubkey alias churn
- Exploit idea: search for split-brain visibility between rooted and flushed state
- Invariant to test: root visibility and flushed persistence must not diverge in externally observable ways
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: read the same pubkey during root movement and compare rooted versus cached answers
