# Q1516: NEAR bind_token entry same remote asset deployable via multiple proof paths via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `bind_token` proof-submission flow` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `same remote asset deployable via multiple proof paths` under verifies a deploy-token proof, writes token mappings in `bind_token_callback`, then refunds leftover deposit in a second callback, violating `binding an existing Near token to a foreign asset must remain one-to-one and fully collateral-accounted across proof replay, partial failure, and refund paths`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token`
- Entrypoint: `public `bind_token` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and timing versus token deployment
- Exploit idea: Compare metadata-based deployment, deploy-token binding, native-token deployment, and chain-specific extension paths. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: binding an existing Near token to a foreign asset must remain one-to-one and fully collateral-accounted across proof replay, partial failure, and refund paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Attempt the same remote asset through every supported path and assert that the bridge converges to one canonical local representation. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
