# Q600: Starknet normalize decimals helper decimal cap creates wrong economic model at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public deploy path through `deploy_token`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges and make `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::_normalizeDecimals` violate `decimal normalization must not let a wrapped token represent more or less claimable value than the source asset actually backs` in the `decimal cap creates wrong economic model` attack class because caps decimals to Starknet’s maximum supported value before bridge-token deployment becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::_normalizeDecimals`
- Entrypoint: `public deploy path through `deploy_token``
- Attacker controls: declared remote decimals and all downstream amount conversions that assume the capped value
- Exploit idea: Target capped decimals on EVM, Solana, and Starknet deployments and later amount conversions during sign/finalize/claim flows. Concentrate on decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges.
- Invariant to test: decimal normalization must not let a wrapped token represent more or less claimable value than the source asset actually backs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Deploy high-decimal assets and assert that every later amount conversion preserves one consistent economic relation to the source asset. Sweep boundary values for decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
