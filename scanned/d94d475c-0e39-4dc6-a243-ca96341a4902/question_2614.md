# Q2614: NEAR send_tokens helper callback refund creates value gap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the callback resolution behind `internal helper reached from public finalize and fast paths` to refund tokens, keep a pending claim, or skip a compensating burn in `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens` because of chooses between wNEAR unwrap, bridge-token mint, `ft_transfer`, and `ft_transfer_call` depending on token type and message presence, violating `asset-delivery helper logic must not let attacker-controlled message shape or gas availability change the economic branch in a way that unbacks or strands funds`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens`
- Entrypoint: `internal helper reached from public finalize and fast paths`
- Attacker controls: token id, recipient account, amount, optional message, current gas budget, and whether the token is wNEAR, deployed, or external
- Exploit idea: Target `ft_transfer_call`-style paths where refund semantics affect whether state is removed or custody is burned.
- Invariant to test: asset-delivery helper logic must not let attacker-controlled message shape or gas availability change the economic branch in a way that unbacks or strands funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Simulate every callback result and assert that no branch leaves both user-accessible funds and a still-live bridge claim for the same transfer.
