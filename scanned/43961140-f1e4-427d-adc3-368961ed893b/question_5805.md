# Q5805: WombatBribeManager.unvote - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
In wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Does `unvote(address _lp)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the victim has a large unsettled balance in the pool rewarder, so that `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` diverges from `totalVlMgpInVote`, the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates is broken, and the result is Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `unvote(address _lp)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `unvote(address _lp)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lp and the moment the whole position on that pool is released
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the victim has a large unsettled balance in the pool rewarder.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` must stay reconciled with `totalVlMgpInVote`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the victim has a large unsettled balance in the pool rewarder, have the attacker run `unvote(address _lp)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` versus `totalVlMgpInVote` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
