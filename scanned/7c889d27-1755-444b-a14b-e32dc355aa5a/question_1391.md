# Q1391: withdraw CPI signer confusion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `withdraw` by submit transactions invoking writable-account instructions with lamport amounts, account ownership transitions, cpi ordering, and close/reopen patterns such that nested invocation state lets attacker-controlled signer or writable flags be translated inconsistently, breaking the invariant that cpi must preserve signer and writable semantics exactly and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::withdraw
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking writable-account instructions
- Attacker controls: lamport amounts, account ownership transitions, CPI ordering, and close/reopen patterns
- Exploit idea: look for ways to gain authority or write access through CPI translation mismatches
- Invariant to test: CPI must preserve signer and writable semantics exactly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: build nested CPI graphs with repeated accounts and diff signer/writable sets at each level
