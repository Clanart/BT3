# Q3847: get-asset-value via liquidate-redeem: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the redemption receiver, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, then read `get-asset-value` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
