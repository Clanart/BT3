# Q2756: load_latest same-pubkey churn hotspot

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_latest` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads for hot accounts under continuous rewrites with same-pubkey rewrites across slots with immediate reads so that rewriting one pubkey repeatedly creates pathological behavior that normal multi-pubkey load does not, breaking the invariant that hot-key churn should not create correctness or performance pathologies and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::load_latest
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads for hot accounts under continuous rewrites
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey rewrites across slots with immediate reads
- Exploit idea: use hot-key churn rather than broad fanout
- Invariant to test: hot-key churn should not create correctness or performance pathologies
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: compare same-pubkey rewrite churn against equally large multi-pubkey churn
