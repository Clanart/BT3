# Q3122: serialize condition overflow or underflow a boundary check via AGG SIG ME and AGG SIG UNSAFE condition mixes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call the Python validation API with attacker-controlled spends targeting `serialize_condition` in `crates/chia-consensus/src/spendbundle_conditions.rs` with AGG_SIG_ME and AGG_SIG_UNSAFE condition mixes when the attacker can choose ordering inside a batch make chia_rs overflow or underflow a boundary check, violating the invariant that amounts and coin ids remain canonical after sanitization, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-consensus/src/spendbundle_conditions.rs:387` / `serialize_condition`
- Entrypoint: call the Python validation API with attacker-controlled spends
- Attacker controls: AGG_SIG_ME and AGG_SIG_UNSAFE condition mixes
- Exploit idea: Drive `serialize_condition` through its public caller path using AGG_SIG_ME and AGG_SIG_UNSAFE condition mixes; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: amounts and coin ids remain canonical after sanitization
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data
- Fast validation: fuzz condition atoms and assert validation never accepts the forbidden spend.
