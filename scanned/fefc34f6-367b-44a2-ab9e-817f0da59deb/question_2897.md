# Q2897: notify_slot_update index inconsistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_slot_update` by trigger slot-related subscriptions and then drive hot transaction flow with slow consumer behavior and high-frequency slot events so that indexes or lookup tables updated around this function can disagree with the stored account payloads they point to, breaking the invariant that indexes must resolve to the exact account version later returned to rpc or runtime callers and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_slot_update
- Entrypoint: trigger slot-related subscriptions and then drive hot transaction flow
- Attacker controls: slow consumer behavior and high-frequency slot events
- Exploit idea: force same-pubkey and same-owner churn to look for torn index state
- Invariant to test: indexes must resolve to the exact account version later returned to RPC or runtime callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare indexed reads to direct storage reads during high-churn updates
