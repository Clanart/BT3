# Q1288: Exploit replacement logic in bump_fees_of_unconfirmed_fee_payer_txs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the `fee_paying_type` choice so `bump_fees_of_unconfirmed_fee_payer_txs` constructs a replacement path that copies the wrong witnesses, inputs, or fee logic, corrupting the binding between raw transaction bytes and the queued tx-sender metadata and violating the invariant that RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/cpfp.rs::bump_fees_of_unconfirmed_fee_payer_txs
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `fee_paying_type` choice
- Exploit idea: copy the wrong witnesses, inputs, or fee logic by shaping the `fee_paying_type` choice
- Invariant to test: RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
