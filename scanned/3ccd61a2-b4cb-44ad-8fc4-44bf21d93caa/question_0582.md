# Q582: EVM Wormhole initTransferExtension origin and destination nonce desynchronization at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public outbound flow through `initTransfer` on Wormhole-backed chains` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::initTransferExtension` violate `outbound message publication must remain one-to-one with consumed assets and must not diverge under underpayment, overpayment, or callback/retry edge cases` in the `origin and destination nonce desynchronization` attack class because serializes a Wormhole `InitTransfer` payload and publishes it using the current nonce and supplied value becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::initTransferExtension`
- Entrypoint: `public outbound flow through `initTransfer` on Wormhole-backed chains`
- Attacker controls: msg.value passed as `value`, current `wormholeNonce`, sender, token address, origin nonce, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, and message
- Exploit idea: Drive retries, resume paths, or recursive bridge legs until one deposit appears under more than one transfer identity. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: outbound message publication must remain one-to-one with consumed assets and must not diverge under underpayment, overpayment, or callback/retry edge cases
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trace every nonce mutation site and fuzz repeated calls plus reordered callbacks to prove that one deposit cannot create two valid transfer ids or destination messages. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
