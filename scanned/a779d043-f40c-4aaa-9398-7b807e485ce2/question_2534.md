# Q2534: NewEVMSigPreVerifier - Bad Chain Id Tx Bypasses Early Rejection And Reaches Locked Path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit, replace, reorder, or batch pending transactions through `raw transaction submitted to app mempool preverification` while controlling `extension option ordering` and `replacement tx`, under the precondition that the tx contains multiple messages but one extracted signer, drive `raw tx bytes -> EVMSigPreVerifier -> signer extraction -> priority nonce mempool` in `appmempool/preverify.go::NewEVMSigPreVerifier` so that bad-chain-ID tx bypasses early rejection and reaches locked path, violating the invariant that preverification cannot accept a tx consensus will execute under a different identity, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `appmempool/preverify.go::NewEVMSigPreVerifier`
- Entrypoint: `raw transaction submitted to app mempool preverification`
- Attacker controls: `extension option ordering`, `replacement tx`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: bad-chain-ID tx bypasses early rejection and reaches locked path through `raw tx bytes -> EVMSigPreVerifier -> signer extraction -> priority nonce mempool`.
- Invariant to test: preverification cannot accept a tx consensus will execute under a different identity.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: replay the same scenario through eth_call or estimateGas and through eth_sendRawTransaction and assert the only difference is persistence.
