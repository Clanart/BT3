# Q5247: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.withdraw - withdraw releases the underlying before the stake check runs

## Question
In wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, withdraw() calls IWombatStaking(wombatStaking).withdraw first, which sends the deposit token to msg.sender, and only afterwards calls _unstake, which is the step that actually verifies the caller had that much staked in MasterMagpie. Starting from a state where the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, can an unprivileged EOA use `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` to leave `this.balance(msg.sender)` inconsistent with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`, violating the invariant that an entitlement must be verified before the value backing it leaves the protocol and extracting Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: withdraw releases the underlying before the stake check runs)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check
- Exploit idea: withdraw() calls IWombatStaking(wombatStaking).withdraw first, which sends the deposit token to msg.sender, and only afterwards calls _unstake, which is the step that actually verifies the caller had that much staked in MasterMagpie. Precondition: the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction.
- Invariant to test: an entitlement must be verified before the value backing it leaves the protocol; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, snapshot `this.balance(msg.sender)` and `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`, run the attacker's `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
