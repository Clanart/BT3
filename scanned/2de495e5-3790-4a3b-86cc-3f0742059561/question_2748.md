# Q2748: NEAR resolve_utxo_fin_transfer custody accounting diverges from wrapped supply via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `callback after sending tokens for UTXO-to-Near settlement` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::resolve_utxo_fin_transfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `custody accounting diverges from wrapped supply` under interprets callback refund semantics and either removes tracked UTXO finalization state or emits the completed event, violating `UTXO resolution must not leave the same origin transfer both payable and replayable after callback edge cases`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::resolve_utxo_fin_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `callback after sending tokens for UTXO-to-Near settlement`
- Attacker controls: token id, amount, callback outcome, UTXO transfer message, origin chain, and storage owner
- Exploit idea: Target branches that mint, burn, lock, unlock, transfer vault assets, or unwrap native value. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: UTXO resolution must not leave the same origin transfer both payable and replayable after callback edge cases
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Build a per-asset conservation model and assert that total claims never exceed total backing after every public flow. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
