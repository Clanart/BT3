# Q858: Misbind trusted context inside upsert_get_deposit_signatures

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `upsert_get_deposit_signatures` through public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline and make attacker-controlled the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit` bind to the wrong trusted context, so the deposit-to-move-tx binding is interpreted for one bridge action while authorizing another, violating the invariant that partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/operator.rs::upsert_get_deposit_signatures
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit`
- Exploit idea: bind attacker-controlled the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit` to the wrong trusted bridge context
- Invariant to test: partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
