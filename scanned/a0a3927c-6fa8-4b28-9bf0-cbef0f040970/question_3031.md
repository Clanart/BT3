# Q3031: oracle-price-legal via collateral-remove-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), then read `oracle-price-legal` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
