# Q5665: WombatPoolHelper.harvest - V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. With the exact block at which the pool's rewards are harvested and fee-split under attacker control and the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, can an unprivileged caller sequence `harvest()` so that `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` and `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal and realising Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the exact block at which the pool's rewards are harvested and fee-split
- Exploit idea: WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, then assert `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` and `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` end identical in both runs.
