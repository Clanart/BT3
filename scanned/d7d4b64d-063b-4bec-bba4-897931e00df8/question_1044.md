# Q1044: purge_all_bank_snapshots can serve state that disagrees with the cache (snapshot_utils.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `purge_all_bank_snapshots` in `runtime/src/snapshot_utils.rs` with a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot, and make the bank's capitalization counter disagree with the sum of lamports across all accounts, so that the invariant "Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/snapshot_utils.rs` -> `purge_all_bank_snapshots()` (around line 1756)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot
- Exploit idea: Make `purge_all_bank_snapshots` read a cached value the attacker already invalidated, so a node with a warm cache commits different state than one that reloaded.
- Invariant to test: Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Test the path with the cache primed and cleared; assert the committed state is identical in both runs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy or upgrade a program, or poison the program cache, so honest validators execute different bytecode or produce different results for the same instruction.
