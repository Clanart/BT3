# Q1847: get-cached-indexes via redeem: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
`get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing `recipient`, use that to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, violating the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `redeem` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `recipient`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
