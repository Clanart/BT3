# Q5479: WombatBribeManager.claimAllBribes - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
In wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Does `claimAllBribes(address _for)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the attacker passes offsetting positive and negative deltas that net to zero, so that `targetVote computed in castVotes` diverges from `totalVotes() from veWom.balanceOf(wombatStaking)`, the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates is broken, and the result is Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `claimAllBribes(address _for)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `claimAllBribes(address _for)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _for (any victim) and the block at which every pool rewarder is settled for them
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the attacker passes offsetting positive and negative deltas that net to zero.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `targetVote computed in castVotes` must stay reconciled with `totalVotes() from veWom.balanceOf(wombatStaking)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the attacker passes offsetting positive and negative deltas that net to zero, have the attacker run `claimAllBribes(address _for)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `targetVote computed in castVotes` versus `totalVotes() from veWom.balanceOf(wombatStaking)` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
