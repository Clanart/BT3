# Q4484: mWOM.deposit - _convert transfers WOM before the veWOM lock is confirmed

## Question
In wombat/mWOM.sol, for the _doConvert path, _convert() sends the WOM to wombatStaking and then calls _lockWom, so the WOM is out of this contract's control before the lock result is known and any third party call to convertAllWom in between changes the attribution. Starting from a state where the attacker sizes _amount so that vlMGPAmount exactly equals the MGP balance, can an unprivileged EOA use `deposit(uint256 _amount)` to leave `rewardRatio` inconsistent with `DENOMINATOR`, violating the invariant that value must not leave the accounting contract before the step that accounts for it has completed and extracting Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWOM.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount)` (mechanism: _convert transfers WOM before the veWOM lock is confirmed)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, which mints mWOM 1:1 while leaving the WOM sitting in this contract unlocked
- Exploit idea: for the _doConvert path, _convert() sends the WOM to wombatStaking and then calls _lockWom, so the WOM is out of this contract's control before the lock result is known and any third party call to convertAllWom in between changes the attribution. Precondition: the attacker sizes _amount so that vlMGPAmount exactly equals the MGP balance.
- Invariant to test: value must not leave the accounting contract before the step that accounts for it has completed; concretely, `rewardRatio` must stay reconciled with `DENOMINATOR`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the attacker sizes _amount so that vlMGPAmount exactly equals the MGP balance, then assert `rewardRatio` and `DENOMINATOR` end identical in both runs.
