# Q3619: NEAR Wormhole prover verify_proof address normalization changes authenticated subject at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Wormhole proof verifier entrypoint` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/lib.rs::verify_proof` violate `the externally-approved VAA and the locally-parsed bridge message must remain identical in proof kind, emitter binding, and payload interpretation` in the `address normalization changes authenticated subject` attack class because logs the supplied VAA, asks the external prover to validate it, and then parses the same VAA locally in the callback becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/lib.rs::verify_proof`
- Entrypoint: `public Wormhole proof verifier entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: serialized `WormholeVerifyProofArgs`, VAA hex string, claimed proof kind, and timing against other proof submissions
- Exploit idea: Target hex, byte-array, and account-id conversions between proof parsing and token/recipient lookup. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: the externally-approved VAA and the locally-parsed bridge message must remain identical in proof kind, emitter binding, and payload interpretation
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Round-trip every proof-derived address through all local conversions and assert that normalization never changes the bridge subject. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
