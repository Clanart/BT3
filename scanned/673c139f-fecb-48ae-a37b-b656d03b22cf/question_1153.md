# Q1153: Exploit ordering assumptions in process_new_blocks

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use attacker-controlled multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context so `process_new_blocks` validates the right inputs in the wrong order, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and breaking the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/bitcoin_syncer.rs::process_new_blocks
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: validate the right pieces in the wrong order using multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
