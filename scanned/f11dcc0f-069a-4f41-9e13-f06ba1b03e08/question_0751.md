# Q0751: mWOMSVBaseRewarder.getReward - donateRewards(uint256,address) is additionally exposed to any caller for already-registered reward tokens

## Question
In rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol, this additional entry point widens who can move the pool's accounting state, so the set of actors able to choose when the reward index changes is larger than the manager role the design assumes. Does `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the account is inside its cooldown window so getRewardablePercentWAD is exactly 1e18, so that `balanceOf(account)` diverges from `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`, the invariant that only an authorised manager may decide when and by how much the reward index moves is broken, and the result is High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: donateRewards(uint256,address) is additionally exposed to any caller for already-registered reward tokens)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the settlement timing, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim and through the locker's unlock path
- Exploit idea: this additional entry point widens who can move the pool's accounting state, so the set of actors able to choose when the reward index changes is larger than the manager role the design assumes. Precondition: the account is inside its cooldown window so getRewardablePercentWAD is exactly 1e18.
- Invariant to test: only an authorised manager may decide when and by how much the reward index moves; concretely, `balanceOf(account)` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the account is inside its cooldown window so getRewardablePercentWAD is exactly 1e18, snapshot `balanceOf(account)` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`, run the attacker's `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
