# Q4358: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.withdraw - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
In wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Starting from a state where the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, can an unprivileged EOA use `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` to leave `this.balance(msg.sender)` inconsistent with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`, violating the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard and extracting Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check) under the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, asserting on every row that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard.
