# Q4404: mWOMSVBaseRewarder.getRewards - forfeited value recycled to the same stakers who forfeited it

## Question
Note that in rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol, _sendReward() routes forfeitAmount into _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer(), which raises rewardPerTokenStored for everyone currently staked including the forfeiting account, so a dominant staker recovers most of their own forfeit. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` under the victim has not settled for several epochs and holds a large userRewards balance and force `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` apart from `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`, breaking the invariant that value forfeited on exit must accrue to the users who remained committed, not back to the exiting account for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: forfeited value recycled to the same stakers who forfeited it)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() routes forfeitAmount into _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer(), which raises rewardPerTokenStored for everyone currently staked including the forfeiting account, so a dominant staker recovers most of their own forfeit. Precondition: the victim has not settled for several epochs and holds a large userRewards balance.
- Invariant to test: value forfeited on exit must accrue to the users who remained committed, not back to the exiting account; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the victim has not settled for several epochs and holds a large userRewards balance, then assert `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` and `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` end identical in both runs.
