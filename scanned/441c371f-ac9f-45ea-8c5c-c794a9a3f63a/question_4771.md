# Q4771: MasterMagpie.updatePool - massUpdatePools reachable by anyone while paused state flips

## Question
In rewards/MasterMagpie.sol, massUpdatePools() and updatePool() are permissionless and only gated by whenNotPaused, so an attacker controls the exact timestamps at which every pool's accMGPPerShare is rebased relative to their own deposit and withdraw transactions. Starting from a state where the pool's rewarder is a V2 rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol that caches stakingTokenDecimals at construction, can an unprivileged EOA use `updatePool(address _stakingToken)` to leave `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].amount` inconsistent with `_calLpSupply(_stakingToken)`, violating the invariant that no external actor may choose the accrual checkpoints that price other users' deposits and extracting High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `updatePool(address _stakingToken)` (mechanism: massUpdatePools reachable by anyone while paused state flips)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `updatePool(address _stakingToken)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _stakingToken and the timestamp at which accMGPPerShare is rolled forward
- Exploit idea: massUpdatePools() and updatePool() are permissionless and only gated by whenNotPaused, so an attacker controls the exact timestamps at which every pool's accMGPPerShare is rebased relative to their own deposit and withdraw transactions. Precondition: the pool's rewarder is a V2 rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol that caches stakingTokenDecimals at construction.
- Invariant to test: no external actor may choose the accrual checkpoints that price other users' deposits; concretely, `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].amount` must stay reconciled with `_calLpSupply(_stakingToken)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_stakingToken and the timestamp at which accMGPPerShare is rolled forward) under the pool's rewarder is a V2 rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol that caches stakingTokenDecimals at construction, asserting on every row that no external actor may choose the accrual checkpoints that price other users' deposits.
