# Q1638: process_instruction rent floor drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_instruction` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with versioned messages, duplicate accounts, alt expansion, and cpi-heavy instruction graphs such that account resize, close, or reopen patterns can use a stale rent-exemption view, breaking the invariant that rent-exemption checks must use the final committed account layout and balance and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs::process_instruction
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, duplicate accounts, ALT expansion, and CPI-heavy instruction graphs
- Exploit idea: search for pre-resize or pre-close rent assumptions that survive too long
- Invariant to test: rent-exemption checks must use the final committed account layout and balance
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: use realloc/close/open patterns and diff rent floor checks against final account sizes
