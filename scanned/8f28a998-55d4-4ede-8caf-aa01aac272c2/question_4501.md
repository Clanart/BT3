# Q4501: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.deposit - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol - WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _amount and _minimumLiquidity, under an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, exploit this through `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` to break the reconciliation between `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` and `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` and the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding, yielding High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, snapshot `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` and `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`, run the attacker's `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
