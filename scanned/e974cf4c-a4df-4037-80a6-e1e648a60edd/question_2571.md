# Q2571: mark_slot_frozen zero-lamport resurrection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `mark_slot_frozen` by submit transactions that maximize write churn near slot boundaries with heavy write churn near slot-freeze boundaries so that dead or zero-lamport accounts can survive or reappear because cleanup and load paths disagree, breaking the invariant that closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::mark_slot_frozen
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that maximize write churn near slot boundaries
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn near slot-freeze boundaries
- Exploit idea: look for stale dead-account visibility after close/recreate churn
- Invariant to test: closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: close and recreate the same attacker-controlled account shape repeatedly
