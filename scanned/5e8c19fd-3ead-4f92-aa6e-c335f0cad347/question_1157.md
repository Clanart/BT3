# Q1157: Exploit ordering assumptions in fetch_new_blocks_backwards

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use attacker-controlled Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents so `fetch_new_blocks_backwards` validates the right inputs in the wrong order, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/bitcoin_syncer.rs::fetch_new_blocks_backwards
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Exploit idea: validate the right pieces in the wrong order using Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
