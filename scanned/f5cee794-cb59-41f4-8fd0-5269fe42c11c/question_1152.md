# Q1152: Exploit ordering assumptions in handle_reorg_events

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use attacker-controlled the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values so `handle_reorg_events` validates the right inputs in the wrong order, corrupting the storage-proof key/value binding used for deposit or withdrawal validation and breaking the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/bitcoin_syncer.rs::handle_reorg_events
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Exploit idea: validate the right pieces in the wrong order using the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
