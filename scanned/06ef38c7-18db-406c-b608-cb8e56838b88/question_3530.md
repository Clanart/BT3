# Q3530: LegacyEip712SigVerificationDecorator.AnteHandle - Chain Id From Context Differs From Eip 712 Domain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a legacy EIP-712/Web3Tx signed Cosmos transaction through `Cosmos Web3Tx extension-option ante path` while controlling `chain ID string` and `fee payer`, under the precondition that the payload contains authz or fee delegation, drive `EIP-712 typed data generation -> LegacyEip712SigVerificationDecorator -> Cosmos message execution` in `ante/cosmos/eip712.go::LegacyEip712SigVerificationDecorator.AnteHandle` so that chain ID from context differs from EIP-712 domain, violating the invariant that legacy typed data must not replay across Cronos chains, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `ante/cosmos/eip712.go::LegacyEip712SigVerificationDecorator.AnteHandle`
- Entrypoint: `Cosmos Web3Tx extension-option ante path`
- Attacker controls: `chain ID string`, `fee payer`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: chain ID from context differs from EIP-712 domain through `EIP-712 typed data generation -> LegacyEip712SigVerificationDecorator -> Cosmos message execution`.
- Invariant to test: legacy typed data must not replay across Cronos chains.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: build a two-message Cosmos tx fixture and assert ante, execution, refund, and receipt invariants after FinalizeBlock.
