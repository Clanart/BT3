# Q4726: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getRewards - InvalidRewardableAmount revert bricks a user's claims

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, _calExpireForfeit() reverts with InvalidRewardableAmount whenever rewardableAmount exceeds _amount, and rewardablePercentWAD is computed inside vlMGP from getUserTotalLocked, which itself can underflow, so a single inconsistent lock state makes every claim path for that user revert forever. Starting from a state where a registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer, can an unprivileged EOA use `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` to leave `balanceOf(account)` inconsistent with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`, violating the invariant that a pricing helper on the claim path must never be able to permanently block settlement and extracting Critical - Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: InvalidRewardableAmount revert bricks a user's claims)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: _calExpireForfeit() reverts with InvalidRewardableAmount whenever rewardableAmount exceeds _amount, and rewardablePercentWAD is computed inside vlMGP from getUserTotalLocked, which itself can underflow, so a single inconsistent lock state makes every claim path for that user revert forever. Precondition: a registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer.
- Invariant to test: a pricing helper on the claim path must never be able to permanently block settlement; concretely, `balanceOf(account)` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up a registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer, snapshot `balanceOf(account)` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`, run the attacker's `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
