# Q2816: WombatBribeManager.voteAndCast - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, where because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Assuming the attacker votes in the block immediately before a known keeper cast, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `targetVote computed in castVotes` and `totalVotes() from veWom.balanceOf(wombatStaking)` via `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)`, breaking the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates and producing Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the deltas and the atomic vote-then-cast ordering inside one transaction
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the attacker votes in the block immediately before a known keeper cast.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `targetVote computed in castVotes` must stay reconciled with `totalVotes() from veWom.balanceOf(wombatStaking)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)` sequence atomically under the attacker votes in the block immediately before a known keeper cast, asserting at the end that `targetVote computed in castVotes` still equals `totalVotes() from veWom.balanceOf(wombatStaking)` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
