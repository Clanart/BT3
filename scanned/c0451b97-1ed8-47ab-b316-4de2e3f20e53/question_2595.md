# Q2595: WombatPoolHelperV2.deposit - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, where WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Assuming the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `pid cached at construction` and `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, breaking the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding and producing High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, call `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, and assert `pid cached at construction` equals `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
