# Q2245: Duplicate queue or processing state in save_activated_txid

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `save_activated_txid` twice with attacker-controlled the `signed_tx_hex` payload but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the finalized/seen-at-height status recorded for the send request and violating the invariant that database state must not say a send path is finalized / active when the raw transaction path says otherwise, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/db/tx_sender.rs::save_activated_txid
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Invariant to test: database state must not say a send path is finalized / active when the raw transaction path says otherwise
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
