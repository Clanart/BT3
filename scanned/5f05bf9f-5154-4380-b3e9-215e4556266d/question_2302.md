# Q2302: retry_durable_nonce_transactions duplicate signature split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `retry_durable_nonce_transactions` by use json-rpc `sendtransaction` from one low-rate client with durable nonce transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and queue pressure such that one signature can correspond to meaningfully different downstream work because state tracked here keys off the wrong identity boundary, breaking the invariant that transaction identity used for dedup and status must match executed semantics and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs::retry_durable_nonce_transactions
- Entrypoint: use JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from one low-rate client
- Attacker controls: durable nonce transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and queue pressure
- Exploit idea: look for a mismatch between signature identity and executed write set or retry state
- Invariant to test: transaction identity used for dedup and status must match executed semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: replay semantically different but signature-colliding boundary cases
