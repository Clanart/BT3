# Q3359: NEAR token-deployer deploy_token low-half deploy salt aliases another token id via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `cross-contract token deployment reached from public Near `deploy_token` callback` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/token-deployer/src/lib.rs::deploy_token` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `low-half deploy salt aliases another token id` under controller-only deployer creates a new token subaccount and initializes metadata that downstream bridge flows will trust as canonical, violating `deployment into a predictable subaccount must not let an attacker reuse state, collide names, or create a token whose runtime semantics diverge from the bridge’s assumed wrapped-token model`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/token-deployer/src/lib.rs::deploy_token`
- Entrypoint: `cross-contract token deployment reached from public Near `deploy_token` callback`
- Attacker controls: account id chosen for the new token, metadata supplied by a validated bridge proof, and global code hash state
- Exploit idea: Target Starknet deployment where the full token-id hash is the map key but only the low portion becomes the deploy salt. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: deployment into a predictable subaccount must not let an attacker reuse state, collide names, or create a token whose runtime semantics diverge from the bridge’s assumed wrapped-token model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Search for colliding low-half salts and assert that address derivation remains unique for all deployable token ids. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
