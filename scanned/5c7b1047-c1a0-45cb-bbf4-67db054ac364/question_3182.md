# Q3182: Keeper.GetBaseFee - Zero Params Basefee Falls Back To Legacy Store Unexpectedly

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker fill adjacent blocks with carefully priced public transactions through `fee market base fee read during EVM execution` while controlling `consensus MaxGas` and `block gas used`, under the precondition that London rules are active and BaseFee is enabled, drive `CalculateBaseFee -> SetBaseFee -> RPC BaseFee -> dynamic-fee tx admission` in `x/feemarket/keeper/params.go::Keeper.GetBaseFee` so that zero params.BaseFee falls back to legacy store unexpectedly, violating the invariant that London fee rules must match the active EVM fork rules, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/feemarket/keeper/params.go::Keeper.GetBaseFee`
- Entrypoint: `fee market base fee read during EVM execution`
- Attacker controls: `consensus MaxGas`, `block gas used`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: zero params.BaseFee falls back to legacy store unexpectedly through `CalculateBaseFee -> SetBaseFee -> RPC BaseFee -> dynamic-fee tx admission`.
- Invariant to test: London fee rules must match the active EVM fork rules.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: build a two-message Cosmos tx fixture and assert ante, execution, refund, and receipt invariants after FinalizeBlock.
