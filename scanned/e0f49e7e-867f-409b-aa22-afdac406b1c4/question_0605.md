# Q605: NEAR omni-types EVM event parser recipient or fee-recipient rebinding at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public EVM proof path through `verify_proof_callback`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-types/src/evm/events.rs::parse_evm_proof` violate `event parsing must not let one verified log be reinterpreted as a different bridge action with different recipient, fee, or token semantics` in the `recipient or fee-recipient rebinding` attack class because maps a verified EVM log entry into a typed bridge `ProverResult` used by settlement, fee claim, and token deployment becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-types/src/evm/events.rs::parse_evm_proof`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM proof path through `verify_proof_callback``
- Attacker controls: proof kind, chain kind, raw log-entry bytes, topic layout, and ABI-decoded event fields
- Exploit idea: Exploit optional fee-recipient fields, fast-transfer relayer substitution, or predecessor-captured identities. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: event parsing must not let one verified log be reinterpreted as a different bridge action with different recipient, fee, or token semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Build pairs of proofs/messages that vary only in recipient-oriented fields and assert that settlement, fee claim, and event emission stay bound to one tuple. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
