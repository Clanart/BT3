# Q2366: accounts_db.load result-cloning chain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by submit transactions or make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that force repeated account lookups with high-churn account creation/close patterns, repeated reads, and same-pubkey updates across nearby slots so that large notification objects are cloned more than necessary, breaking the invariant that notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::load
- Entrypoint: submit transactions or make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that force repeated account lookups
- Attacker controls: high-churn account creation/close patterns, repeated reads, and same-pubkey updates across nearby slots
- Exploit idea: look for repeated clones of the same large object
- Invariant to test: notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: profile allocations and clone counts while delivering large notifications
