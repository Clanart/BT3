# Q1088: iter-find-superset via liquidate: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-collateral-expected` reach `iter-find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it short-circuits on the first superset match, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267` -> `iter-find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `iter-find-superset` short-circuits on the first superset match. Reach it through `liquidate` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `min-collateral-expected` varied, and assert that the value `iter-find-superset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
