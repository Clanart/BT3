# Q864: NEAR send_tokens helper recipient or message ambiguity via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `internal helper reached from public finalize and fast paths` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `recipient or message ambiguity` under chooses between wNEAR unwrap, bridge-token mint, `ft_transfer`, and `ft_transfer_call` depending on token type and message presence, violating `asset-delivery helper logic must not let attacker-controlled message shape or gas availability change the economic branch in a way that unbacks or strands funds`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens`
- Entrypoint: `internal helper reached from public finalize and fast paths`
- Attacker controls: token id, recipient account, amount, optional message, current gas budget, and whether the token is wNEAR, deployed, or external
- Exploit idea: Exploit non-canonical string, ByteArray, hex, or account-id forms to make one source-side intent resolve to a different destination-side recipient or message. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: asset-delivery helper logic must not let attacker-controlled message shape or gas availability change the economic branch in a way that unbacks or strands funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Cross-check source-side serialization against every downstream parser and assert that equivalent-looking inputs cannot resolve to distinct destination accounts or app messages. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
