# Q2773: accounts_cache.add_root size-accounting drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `add_root` by submit transactions that touch many accounts near root advancement with many-account writes near root advancement so that byte counters or cache-size accounting can undercount real resident or persisted account state, breaking the invariant that cache and storage size accounting must track actual resident state accurately and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::add_root
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that touch many accounts near root advancement
- Attacker controls: many-account writes near root advancement
- Exploit idea: use large-account churn to separate logical counts from physical bytes
- Invariant to test: cache and storage size accounting must track actual resident state accurately
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: measure counter growth against real resident bytes
