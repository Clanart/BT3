# Q2455: get-position via supply-collateral-add: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), then read `get-position` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
