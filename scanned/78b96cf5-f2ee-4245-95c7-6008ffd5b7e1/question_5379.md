# Q5379: WombatPoolHelperV2.harvest - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, is there an unprivileged sequence of `harvest()` that leaves `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` unreconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`, violates the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding, and delivers High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the harvest timing for the whole pool
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, have the attacker run `harvest()`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` versus `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
