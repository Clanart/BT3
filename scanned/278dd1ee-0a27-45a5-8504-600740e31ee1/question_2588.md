# Q2588: Duplicate queue or processing state in verify_storage_proofs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `verify_storage_proofs` twice with attacker-controlled the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and violating the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/storage_proof.rs::verify_storage_proofs
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
