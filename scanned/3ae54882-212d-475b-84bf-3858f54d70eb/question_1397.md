# Q1397: withdraw status visibility race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `withdraw` by submit transactions invoking writable-account instructions with lamport amounts, account ownership transitions, cpi ordering, and close/reopen patterns such that signature or execution status may become externally visible before the underlying state is durably consistent, breaking the invariant that externally visible status must track durable runtime state transitions and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::withdraw
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking writable-account instructions
- Attacker controls: lamport amounts, account ownership transitions, CPI ordering, and close/reopen patterns
- Exploit idea: surface an impossible early success/failure state
- Invariant to test: externally visible status must track durable runtime state transitions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare status-cache visibility to actual commit points under repeated retries
