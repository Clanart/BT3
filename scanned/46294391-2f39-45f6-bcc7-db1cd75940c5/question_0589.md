# Q589: Solana UsedNonces::use_nonce replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public nonce-tracking path through `finalize_transfer` instructions` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs::use_nonce` violate `nonce tracking must reject every replay while keeping reserve accounting exact, even under gaps, huge nonces, or interleaved PDA initialization` in the `replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly` attack class because tracks nonce usage in bit arrays, updates `max_used_nonce`, and compensates or charges rent to the authority reserve as nonce ranges expand becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs::use_nonce`
- Entrypoint: `public nonce-tracking path through `finalize_transfer` instructions`
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, used-nonces PDA slot, payer funding, authority PDA lamports, and nonce gaps
- Exploit idea: Stress replay-protection state keyed only by nonce, transfer id, or bitmap position across branches and chains. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: nonce tracking must reject every replay while keeping reserve accounting exact, even under gaps, huge nonces, or interleaved PDA initialization
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Replay valid proofs/signatures with altered non-economic fields and assert that only the exact originally-settled event is rejected as already used. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
