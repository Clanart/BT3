# Q2808: HookedStateDB.SetCode - Hooked Previous Code Lookup Differs From Commit State

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker request debug_trace* for crafted included transactions or calls through `debug/trace hooked EIP-7702 or CREATE code mutation` while controlling `transaction index` and `hooked StateDB`, under the precondition that a Cronos-controlled operational path consumes trace output, drive `TraceCall/TraceBlock -> block context setup -> hooked StateDB execution` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb_hooked.go::HookedStateDB.SetCode` so that hooked previous-code lookup differs from commit state, violating the invariant that debug tracing must not mutate committed state or produce a false state used for fund movement, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb_hooked.go::HookedStateDB.SetCode`
- Entrypoint: `debug/trace hooked EIP-7702 or CREATE code mutation`
- Attacker controls: `transaction index`, `hooked StateDB`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: hooked previous-code lookup differs from commit state through `TraceCall/TraceBlock -> block context setup -> hooked StateDB execution`.
- Invariant to test: debug tracing must not mutate committed state or produce a false state used for fund movement.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: write a focused Go unit test around the target function and assert bank supply, sender balance, nonce, code hash, logs, and receipt status before and after.
