# Q2881: vault-socialize-debt via liquidate: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `min-collateral-expected`, drive `vault-socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216) — which routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216` -> `vault-socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `vault-socialize-debt` routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults. Reach it through `liquidate` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `min-collateral-expected`, then read `vault-socialize-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
