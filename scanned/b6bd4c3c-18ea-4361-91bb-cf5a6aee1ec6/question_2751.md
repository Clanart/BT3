# Q2751: NEAR deploy_token entry same remote asset deployable via multiple proof paths via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `deploy_token` proof-submission flow` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `same remote asset deployable via multiple proof paths` under verifies a metadata proof and forwards the attached deposit into `deploy_token_callback` to deploy a wrapped or native bridge token on Near, violating `one remote asset and one metadata event must map to one canonical token deployment with coherent decimals and storage accounting`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token`
- Entrypoint: `public `deploy_token` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and timing relative to other token deployments
- Exploit idea: Compare metadata-based deployment, deploy-token binding, native-token deployment, and chain-specific extension paths. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: one remote asset and one metadata event must map to one canonical token deployment with coherent decimals and storage accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Attempt the same remote asset through every supported path and assert that the bridge converges to one canonical local representation. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
