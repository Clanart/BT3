# Q1889: deploy_program program-deployment race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `deploy_program` by submit transactions invoking the upgradeable bpf loader without trusted authority with loader instruction sequences, duplicated accounts, programdata sizes, and boundary elf payloads such that loader state and runtime state can disagree about whether a program version is executable when this function runs, breaking the invariant that program executability must be consistent across loader and runtime checks and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/deploy.rs::deploy_program
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking the upgradeable BPF loader without trusted authority
- Attacker controls: loader instruction sequences, duplicated accounts, programdata sizes, and boundary ELF payloads
- Exploit idea: look for invocation windows around deploy/upgrade/close boundaries
- Invariant to test: program executability must be consistent across loader and runtime checks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race upgrade/close transactions against repeated invocation of the same program id
