# Q3128: Starknet ETH-signature domain signature malleability or alternate recovery at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Starknet deploy/finalize entrypoints` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token and fin_transfer signature path` violate `signature bytes must stay uniquely bound to the intended Starknet action, chain context, and payload kind and must reject malleable variants` in the `signature malleability or alternate recovery` attack class because recovers an Ethereum-style signer over raw Keccak of Borsh bytes rather than a structured Starknet domain separator becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token and fin_transfer signature path`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet deploy/finalize entrypoints`
- Attacker controls: payload bytes, chain id fields embedded in payload, and signature `v/r/s` values
- Exploit idea: Target `v/r/s` normalization, ECDSA recovery semantics, and Ethereum-style signature handling on non-Ethereum chains. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: signature bytes must stay uniquely bound to the intended Starknet action, chain context, and payload kind and must reject malleable variants
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Try low-s/high-s and alternate-`v` forms and assert that recovery either rejects them or yields one unique signer and one unique message. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
