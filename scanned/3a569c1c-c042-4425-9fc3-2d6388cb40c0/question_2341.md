# Q2341: SmartWomConvert.smartConvert - safeApprove without reset on the mWOM mint leg

## Question
wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol: _convertFor() calls IERC20(wom).safeApprove(mWom, convertAmount) with no reset before IMWom(mWom).deposit, so residue there disables conversion entirely. Under womCash exceeds womLiability so maxSwapAmount returns zero and convertRatio stays at DENOMINATOR, is there an unprivileged sequence of `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` that leaves `maxSwapAmount()` unreconciled with `IAsset(womAsset).cash() and IAsset(womAsset).liability()`, violates the invariant that the mint leg must remain usable regardless of allowance residue, and delivers High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol -> `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset on the mWOM mint leg)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountIn and _mode, plus the pool state that currentRatio and maxSwapAmount are read from
- Exploit idea: _convertFor() calls IERC20(wom).safeApprove(mWom, convertAmount) with no reset before IMWom(mWom).deposit, so residue there disables conversion entirely. Precondition: womCash exceeds womLiability so maxSwapAmount returns zero and convertRatio stays at DENOMINATOR.
- Invariant to test: the mint leg must remain usable regardless of allowance residue; concretely, `maxSwapAmount()` must stay reconciled with `IAsset(womAsset).cash() and IAsset(womAsset).liability()`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amountIn and _mode, plus the pool state that currentRatio and maxSwapAmount are read from) under womCash exceeds womLiability so maxSwapAmount returns zero and convertRatio stays at DENOMINATOR, asserting on every row that the mint leg must remain usable regardless of allowance residue.
