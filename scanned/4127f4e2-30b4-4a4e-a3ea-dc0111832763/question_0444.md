# Q0444: SmartWomConvert.convertFor - safeApprove without reset on the mWOM mint leg

## Question
In wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol, _convertFor() calls IERC20(wom).safeApprove(mWom, convertAmount) with no reset before IMWom(mWom).deposit, so residue there disables conversion entirely. Does `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the attacker has pushed mWom below buybackThreshold against wom in the same transaction, so that `obtainedmWomAmount` diverges from `IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this))`, the invariant that the mint leg must remain usable regardless of allowance residue is broken, and the result is High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol -> `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset on the mWOM mint leg)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _for, _convertRatio, _minRec and _mode, reachable directly and through ManualCompound.compound
- Exploit idea: _convertFor() calls IERC20(wom).safeApprove(mWom, convertAmount) with no reset before IMWom(mWom).deposit, so residue there disables conversion entirely. Precondition: the attacker has pushed mWom below buybackThreshold against wom in the same transaction.
- Invariant to test: the mint leg must remain usable regardless of allowance residue; concretely, `obtainedmWomAmount` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)` sequence atomically under the attacker has pushed mWom below buybackThreshold against wom in the same transaction, asserting at the end that `obtainedmWomAmount` still equals `IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this))` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
