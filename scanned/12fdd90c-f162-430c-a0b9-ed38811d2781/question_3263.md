# Q3263: get_data_slice can be driven into unbounded work (ed25519.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `get_data_slice` in `precompiles/src/ed25519.rs` with a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write, and make `get_data_slice` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `get_data_slice` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `precompiles/src/ed25519.rs` -> `get_data_slice()` (around line 81)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `get_data_slice` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `get_data_slice` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `get_data_slice` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft bytecode, ELF metadata, precompile data, or zk proof input that panics, aborts, infinite-loops, or exhausts memory inside the VM and halts every validator.
