# Q0569: iter-lookup-collateral via supply-collateral-add: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, drive `iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) — which skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position — to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, breaking the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
