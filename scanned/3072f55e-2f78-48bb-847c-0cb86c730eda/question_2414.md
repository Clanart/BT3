# Q2414: vault-accrue via repay: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, can an unprivileged attacker make `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `repay` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list varied, and assert that the value `vault-accrue` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
