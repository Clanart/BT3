# Q1132: try_process_entry_transactions duplicate signature split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `try_process_entry_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with batched conflicting transactions, duplicate signatures, and entry-boundary timing such that one signature can correspond to meaningfully different downstream work because state tracked here keys off the wrong identity boundary, breaking the invariant that transaction identity used for dedup and status must match executed semantics and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::try_process_entry_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: batched conflicting transactions, duplicate signatures, and entry-boundary timing
- Exploit idea: look for a mismatch between signature identity and executed write set or retry state
- Invariant to test: transaction identity used for dedup and status must match executed semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: replay semantically different but signature-colliding boundary cases
