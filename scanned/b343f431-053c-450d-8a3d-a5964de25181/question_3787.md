# Q3787: price-multi-resolve via borrow: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`price-multi-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397) folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers, use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397` -> `price-multi-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `price-multi-resolve` folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end. Reach it through `borrow` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, then read `price-multi-resolve` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
