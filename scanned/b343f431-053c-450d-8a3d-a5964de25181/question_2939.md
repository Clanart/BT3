# Q2939: create via liquidate: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
`create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `debt-amount`, use that to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `debt-amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
