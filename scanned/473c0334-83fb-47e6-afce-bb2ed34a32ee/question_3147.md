# Q3147: BlockGasLimit - Estimategas Uses One Cap While Delivertx Uses Another

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `block gas limit lookup for EVM execution and estimates` while controlling `tip cap` and `baseFee`, under the precondition that the sender has just enough EVM-denom balance for the advertised cost, drive `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas` in `types/block.go::BlockGasLimit` so that estimateGas uses one cap while DeliverTx uses another, violating the invariant that gas limits below intrinsic or floor-data gas must not commit, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `types/block.go::BlockGasLimit`
- Entrypoint: `block gas limit lookup for EVM execution and estimates`
- Attacker controls: `tip cap`, `baseFee`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: estimateGas uses one cap while DeliverTx uses another through `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas`.
- Invariant to test: gas limits below intrinsic or floor-data gas must not commit.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: compare IndexBlock/GetTransactionReceipt/GetBlockReceipts output against direct block/result reconstruction for the same transaction.
