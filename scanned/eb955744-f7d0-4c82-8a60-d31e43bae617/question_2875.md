# Q2875: Allowance Window Drift After Partial State Change

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BandwidthManager.purchase(...) -> pallet_ismp::handle_unsigned(origin=None, messages)` with attacker-controlled authenticated purchase messages, app and chain identifiers, tier configuration values, and replay ordering and replaying the same public flow after one part of storage changed and another part did not, and make `try_from` make remaining allowance, subscription expiry, or renewal logic diverge from purchased credit so `the remaining allowance or subscription window` becomes inconsistent with `the precise purchased schedule and bytes entitlement`, breaking the invariant that remaining bandwidth and expiry windows must track purchased credit monotonically without duplicate application or skipped depletion and leading to High: permanent lock, burn, or loss of user funds or rewards in a production flow?

## Target
- File/function: modules/pallets/bandwidth/src/abi.rs::try_from
- Entrypoint: BandwidthManager.purchase(...) -> pallet_ismp::handle_unsigned(origin=None, messages)
- Attacker controls: authenticated purchase messages, app and chain identifiers, tier configuration values, and replay ordering
- Exploit idea: Make remaining allowance, subscription expiry, or renewal logic diverge from purchased credit. Drive a partial success or revert path first, then replay the same user-controlled input and check whether stale state is reused.
- Invariant to test: remaining bandwidth and expiry windows must track purchased credit monotonically without duplicate application or skipped depletion
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: permanent lock, burn, or loss of user funds or rewards in a production flow.
- Fast validation: Purchase, consume, and renew across boundary conditions and assert no extra credit appears and no live credit disappears. Exercise a success-then-replay or fail-then-replay sequence and assert claimed flags, receipts, escrow, and nonces stay coherent.
