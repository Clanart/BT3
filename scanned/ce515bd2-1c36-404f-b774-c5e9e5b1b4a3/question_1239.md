# Q1239: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getReward - forfeit erased by settling during cooldown

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, _calExpireForfeit() multiplies the pending amount by vlMGP.getRewardablePercentWAD(_account), which stays at exactly 1e18 for the whole cooldown window, so a user who has already started their exit forfeits nothing. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` while the account's slot matured recently so the percent has only just begun to decay, and drive `balanceOf(account)` out of agreement with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked` - breaking the invariant that the forfeit must reflect the lock commitment actually served, not the settlement instant the user chose - for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: forfeit erased by settling during cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the settlement timing, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim and through the locker's unlock path
- Exploit idea: _calExpireForfeit() multiplies the pending amount by vlMGP.getRewardablePercentWAD(_account), which stays at exactly 1e18 for the whole cooldown window, so a user who has already started their exit forfeits nothing. Precondition: the account's slot matured recently so the percent has only just begun to decay.
- Invariant to test: the forfeit must reflect the lock commitment actually served, not the settlement instant the user chose; concretely, `balanceOf(account)` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the account's slot matured recently so the percent has only just begun to decay, snapshot `balanceOf(account)` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`, run the attacker's `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
