# Q2944: NewDynamicFeeChecker - Dynamic Fee Extension Omitted Defaults Priority To Maxint64

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `Cosmos tx dynamic-fee checker with EVM fee market params` while controlling `gas limit` and `baseFee`, under the precondition that London and Prague rules are active on the target height, drive `baseFee read -> effective fee calculation -> fee escrow -> leftover gas refund` in `ante/evm/fee_checker.go::NewDynamicFeeChecker` so that dynamic fee extension omitted defaults priority to MaxInt64, violating the invariant that a valid tx must never receive a refund greater than escrowed fees, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `ante/evm/fee_checker.go::NewDynamicFeeChecker`
- Entrypoint: `Cosmos tx dynamic-fee checker with EVM fee market params`
- Attacker controls: `gas limit`, `baseFee`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: dynamic fee extension omitted defaults priority to MaxInt64 through `baseFee read -> effective fee calculation -> fee escrow -> leftover gas refund`.
- Invariant to test: a valid tx must never receive a refund greater than escrowed fees.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: add a fuzz case varying the attacker-controlled fields and differential-check against go-ethereum for tx validity, gas, nonce, and code/storage effects.
