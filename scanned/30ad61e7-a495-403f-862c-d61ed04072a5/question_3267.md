# Q3267: system-borrow via repay: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
`system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:865) independently computes `scaled-amount` with `mul-div-up` from its own `index`, duplicating the market's own scaling of the same borrow. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, use that to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:865` -> `system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `system-borrow` independently computes `scaled-amount` with `mul-div-up` from its own `index`, duplicating the market's own scaling of the same borrow. Reach it through `repay` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `system-borrow` touches, run `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
