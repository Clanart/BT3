# Q0880: WombatPoolHelperV2.harvest - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol - WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling the harvest timing for the whole pool, under the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, exploit this through `harvest()` to break the reconciliation between `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` and the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding, yielding High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the harvest timing for the whole pool
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, have the attacker run `harvest()`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` versus `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
