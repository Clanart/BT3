# Q1541: native_invoke_signed CPI signer confusion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `native_invoke_signed` by submit transactions that perform cpi with instruction ordering, signer seeds, duplicated account metas, writable/read-only aliasing, and nested cpi depth such that nested invocation state lets attacker-controlled signer or writable flags be translated inconsistently, breaking the invariant that cpi must preserve signer and writable semantics exactly and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs::native_invoke_signed
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that perform CPI
- Attacker controls: instruction ordering, signer seeds, duplicated account metas, writable/read-only aliasing, and nested CPI depth
- Exploit idea: look for ways to gain authority or write access through CPI translation mismatches
- Invariant to test: CPI must preserve signer and writable semantics exactly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: build nested CPI graphs with repeated accounts and diff signer/writable sets at each level
