# Q191: NEAR init_transfer_internal origin and destination nonce desynchronization via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `internal path reached from public `ft_on_transfer` and resume logic` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_internal` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `origin and destination nonce desynchronization` under stores the transfer, updates storage balances, burns deployed tokens when needed, locks tokens for non-origin chains, and emits `InitTransfer`, violating `every outbound transfer must either roll back cleanly or leave one fully-backed pending transfer record with the right lock and burn semantics`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_internal`
- Entrypoint: `internal path reached from public `ft_on_transfer` and resume logic`
- Attacker controls: stored transfer contents, storage owner, token id, amount, fee, and destination chain
- Exploit idea: Drive retries, resume paths, or recursive bridge legs until one deposit appears under more than one transfer identity. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: every outbound transfer must either roll back cleanly or leave one fully-backed pending transfer record with the right lock and burn semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trace every nonce mutation site and fuzz repeated calls plus reordered callbacks to prove that one deposit cannot create two valid transfer ids or destination messages. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
