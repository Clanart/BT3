# Q0644: get-available-assets via liquidate-redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the borrower targeted varied, and assert that the value `get-available-assets` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
