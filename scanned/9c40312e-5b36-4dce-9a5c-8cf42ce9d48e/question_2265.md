# Q2265: Duplicate queue or processing state in send_no_funding_tx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `send_no_funding_tx` twice with attacker-controlled the `fee_paying_type` choice but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the cancel/activate dependency graph persisted in the database and violating the invariant that database state must not say a send path is finalized / active when the raw transaction path says otherwise, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/lib.rs::send_no_funding_tx
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `fee_paying_type` choice
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the `fee_paying_type` choice
- Invariant to test: database state must not say a send path is finalized / active when the raw transaction path says otherwise
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
