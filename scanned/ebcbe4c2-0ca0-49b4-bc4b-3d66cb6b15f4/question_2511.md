# Q2511: spawn_internal_central charges far less than it costs (banking_stage.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `spawn_internal_central` in `core/src/banking_stage.rs` with an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction, and make the real CPU/memory cost of `spawn_internal_central` exceed the units charged for it, so that the invariant "Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/banking_stage.rs` -> `spawn_internal_central()` (around line 501)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction
- Exploit idea: Find the input shape where `spawn_internal_central`'s real CPU/memory/IO cost grows much faster than the compute units or fee charged for it.
- Invariant to test: Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Measure real time/allocations versus units charged across input sizes; assert cost/CU ratio stays bounded.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can perform syscall, CPI, memory-mapping, or deserialization work whose real CPU/memory cost far exceeds the compute units charged, degrading nodes below true cost.
