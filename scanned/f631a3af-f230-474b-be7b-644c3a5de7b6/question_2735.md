# Q2735: Confuse confirmation/finalization tracking in try_to_send_unconfirmed_txs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit timing around the `tx_metadata` fields attached to the queued send request so `try_to_send_unconfirmed_txs` records a confirmation/finalization view that diverges from the actual chain state, corrupting the binding between raw transaction bytes and the queued tx-sender metadata and breaking the invariant that RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent, leading to Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/lib.rs::try_to_send_unconfirmed_txs
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `tx_metadata` fields attached to the queued send request
- Exploit idea: diverge chain-observation state from persisted send state using the `tx_metadata` fields attached to the queued send request
- Invariant to test: RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
