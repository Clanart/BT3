# Q759: Misbind storage-proof semantics in fetch_validate_and_store_lcp

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering so `fetch_validate_and_store_lcp` treats one storage slot, value, or path as proving another, corrupting the storage slot/value pair used to prove deposit or withdrawal state and violating the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/citrea.rs::fetch_validate_and_store_lcp
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering
- Exploit idea: treat one storage slot/value/path as if it proved another using Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
