# Q1729: current_shopify_session_id: Online-vs-offline confusion where `online_token_configured?` pi...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params) reach `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb via GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy, supplying online-vs-offline confusion where `online_token_configured?` picks the wrong session_id namespace, so that session id must come from a fully verified id_token (sig, aud, dest, exp) before any load or exchange is violated, leading to authentication bypass / minting an access token for a shop the attacker does not own? Specifically confirm that no encoding variant of the input is accepted as a different-but-trusted value.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb — `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange`
- Entrypoint: GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params — specifically online-vs-offline confusion where `online_token_configured?` picks the wrong session_id namespace.
- Exploit idea: Fuzz the encoding/normalization boundary (case, unicode, punycode, base64 leniency, delimiters).
- Invariant to test: session id must come from a fully verified id_token (sig, aud, dest, exp) before any load or exchange
- Expected Immunefi impact: authentication bypass / minting an access token for a shop the attacker does not own (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: property/fuzz test over encodings asserting sanitize/verify rejects every non-canonical form.
