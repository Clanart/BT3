# Q0034: hmac_valid?: An attempt to exploit `old_secret` acceptance to forge with a r...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the raw request body, the X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header) reach `hmac_valid? / shopify_hmac` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/payload_verification.rb via POST /webhooks/:type (WebhooksController) and the extension verification controller, supplying an attempt to exploit `old_secret` acceptance to forge with a rotated-out secret still configured, so that a missing or malformed HMAC header must fail closed is violated, leading to authentication bypass on the webhook endpoint? Specifically confirm that the activated session binds to the verified token's shop/user, never a disagreeing cookie/param.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/payload_verification.rb — `hmac_valid? / shopify_hmac`
- Entrypoint: POST /webhooks/:type (WebhooksController) and the extension verification controller
- Attacker controls: the raw request body, the X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header — specifically an attempt to exploit `old_secret` acceptance to forge with a rotated-out secret still configured.
- Exploit idea: Present a cookie and a token that disagree on shop/user and confirm the verified token wins, not the cookie.
- Invariant to test: a missing or malformed HMAC header must fail closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: authentication bypass on the webhook endpoint (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: test with a mismatched cookie/token pair asserting the session binds to the verified token's shop/user only.
