# Q3675: Mis-select UTXOs in assert_no_unconfirmed_fee_payers

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker influence the `cancel_outpoints` / `cancel_txids` dependency lists through public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction so `assert_no_unconfirmed_fee_payers` spends, cancels, or activates the wrong UTXO set, corrupting the finalized/seen-at-height status recorded for the send request and breaking the invariant that queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/db/tx_sender.rs::assert_no_unconfirmed_fee_payers
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `cancel_outpoints` / `cancel_txids` dependency lists
- Exploit idea: steer cancellation, activation, or fee selection toward the wrong spend set via the `cancel_outpoints` / `cancel_txids` dependency lists
- Invariant to test: queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
