# Q4202: WombatBribeManager.harvestSinglePool - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
In wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Does `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the delegated pool holds a significant share of poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp, so that `delegatedPool votes` diverges from `totalVlMgpInVote`, the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates is broken, and the result is Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the lp array, forwarded straight into WombatStaking.vote with zero deltas and caller set to address(0)
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the delegated pool holds a significant share of poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `delegatedPool votes` must stay reconciled with `totalVlMgpInVote`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (the lp array, forwarded straight into WombatStaking.vote with zero deltas and caller set to address(0)) under the delegated pool holds a significant share of poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp, asserting on every row that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates.
