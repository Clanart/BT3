# Q1886: deploy_program writeback ordering

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `deploy_program` by submit transactions invoking the upgradeable bpf loader without trusted authority with loader instruction sequences, duplicated accounts, programdata sizes, and boundary elf payloads such that writes can land in a different order than the logic assumed when computing fees, locks, or state deltas, breaking the invariant that writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/deploy.rs::deploy_program
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking the upgradeable BPF loader without trusted authority
- Attacker controls: loader instruction sequences, duplicated accounts, programdata sizes, and boundary ELF payloads
- Exploit idea: search for ordering dependencies that break under batching or CPI
- Invariant to test: writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace write order and derived counters under multi-instruction, multi-CPI transactions
