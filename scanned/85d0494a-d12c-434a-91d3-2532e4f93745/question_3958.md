# Q3958: NewDynamicFeeChecker - Feecap Computed By Integer Division Underprices Basefee

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `Cosmos tx dynamic-fee checker with EVM fee market params` while controlling `multi-message ordering` and `tip cap`, under the precondition that the sender has just enough EVM-denom balance for the advertised cost, drive `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas` in `ante/evm/fee_checker.go::NewDynamicFeeChecker` so that feeCap computed by integer division underprices baseFee, violating the invariant that baseFee and effectiveGasPrice must be consistent across ante, execution, and refund, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `ante/evm/fee_checker.go::NewDynamicFeeChecker`
- Entrypoint: `Cosmos tx dynamic-fee checker with EVM fee market params`
- Attacker controls: `multi-message ordering`, `tip cap`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: feeCap computed by integer division underprices baseFee through `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas`.
- Invariant to test: baseFee and effectiveGasPrice must be consistent across ante, execution, and refund.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: replay the same scenario through eth_call or estimateGas and through eth_sendRawTransaction and assert the only difference is persistence.
