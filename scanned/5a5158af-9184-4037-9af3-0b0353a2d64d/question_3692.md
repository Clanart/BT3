# Q3692: infiniteGasMeterWithLimit.RefundGas - Negative Gas Consumed State Changes Blockgasused

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `custom gas meter refund during EVM transaction accounting` while controlling `refund counter` and `EVM-denom balance`, under the precondition that baseFee changed at BeginBlock, drive `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas` in `types/gasmeter.go::infiniteGasMeterWithLimit.RefundGas` so that negative gas consumed state changes BlockGasUsed, violating the invariant that gas limits below intrinsic or floor-data gas must not commit, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `types/gasmeter.go::infiniteGasMeterWithLimit.RefundGas`
- Entrypoint: `custom gas meter refund during EVM transaction accounting`
- Attacker controls: `refund counter`, `EVM-denom balance`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: negative gas consumed state changes BlockGasUsed through `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas`.
- Invariant to test: gas limits below intrinsic or floor-data gas must not commit.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: compare IndexBlock/GetTransactionReceipt/GetBlockReceipts output against direct block/result reconstruction for the same transaction.
