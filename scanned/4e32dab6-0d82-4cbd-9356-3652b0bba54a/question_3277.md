# Q3277: WombatPoolHelperV2.depositFor - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. With _for (any address) and _amount, with _minimumLiquidity hardcoded to zero under attacker control and a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, can an unprivileged caller sequence `depositFor(uint256 _amount, address _for)` so that `pid cached at construction` and `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value and realising Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `depositFor(uint256 _amount, address _for)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositFor(uint256 _amount, address _for)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _for (any address) and _amount, with _minimumLiquidity hardcoded to zero
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `depositFor(uint256 _amount, address _for)`: constrain the setup so that a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, fuzz the attacker inputs (_for (any address) and _amount, with _minimumLiquidity hardcoded to zero), and assert after every call that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value.
