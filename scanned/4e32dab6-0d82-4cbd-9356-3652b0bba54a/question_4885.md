# Q4885: WombatBribeManager.vote - vote and cast in one transaction with no time weighting

## Question
wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol - voteAndCast() calls vote() and castVotes() back to back, and BribeRewardPool.stakeFor credits the voter immediately while bribes harvested by the cast are queued into rewardPerTokenStored in the same call, so a voter who arrived one instruction earlier takes a full share of a whole epoch of bribes. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries, under the attacker passes the same lp address several times in one array, exploit this through `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` to break the reconciliation between `poolInfos[lp].isActive` and `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]` and the invariant that bribe share must be weighted by the time a vote was actually committed, not by the balance at the instant the bribe is queued, yielding Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` (mechanism: vote and cast in one transaction with no time weighting)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries
- Exploit idea: voteAndCast() calls vote() and castVotes() back to back, and BribeRewardPool.stakeFor credits the voter immediately while bribes harvested by the cast are queued into rewardPerTokenStored in the same call, so a voter who arrived one instruction earlier takes a full share of a whole epoch of bribes. Precondition: the attacker passes the same lp address several times in one array.
- Invariant to test: bribe share must be weighted by the time a vote was actually committed, not by the balance at the instant the bribe is queued; concretely, `poolInfos[lp].isActive` must stay reconciled with `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` sequence atomically under the attacker passes the same lp address several times in one array, asserting at the end that `poolInfos[lp].isActive` still equals `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
