# Q1421: Starknet log_metadata fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public Starknet metadata logging entrypoint` to register or settle against a token that only looks bridge-controlled because `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::log_metadata` relies on performs low-level calls to infer whether metadata fields are returned as `felt252` or `ByteArray`, then emits a `LogMetadata` event, violating `metadata parsing across old and new Starknet token ABIs must not let one token produce ambiguous asset identity data on other chains`?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::log_metadata`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet metadata logging entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: token address and the token’s reported `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` ABI behavior
- Exploit idea: Target checks that only inspect mint authority, owner, or one mapping row without proving the full asset identity.
- Invariant to test: metadata parsing across old and new Starknet token ABIs must not let one token produce ambiguous asset identity data on other chains
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Construct plausible fake bridge-controlled assets and assert that deployment, settlement, and forwarding reject them unless they are the canonical mapping for that remote asset.
