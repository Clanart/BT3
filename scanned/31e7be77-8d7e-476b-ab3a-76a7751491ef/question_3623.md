# Q3623: NEAR Wormhole FinTransfer conversion optional-field encoding ambiguity at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Wormhole fee-claim proof flow` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/parsed_vaa.rs::TryInto<FinTransferMessage>` violate `fee-claim messages must remain bound to the exact destination event, amount, and fee recipient that the destination chain emitted` in the `optional-field encoding ambiguity` attack class because Borsh-decodes a Wormhole payload into `FinTransferMessage` and derives the emitter address from the token chain and VAA emitter bytes becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/parsed_vaa.rs::TryInto<FinTransferMessage>`
- Entrypoint: `public Wormhole fee-claim proof flow`
- Attacker controls: payload bytes inside a validated VAA, fee recipient string, transfer id, token address chain, and amount
- Exploit idea: Focus on empty strings, optional fee recipients, and zero-length messages that are encoded specially. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: fee-claim messages must remain bound to the exact destination event, amount, and fee recipient that the destination chain emitted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Generate payloads that differ only by optional-field encoding and assert that they cannot verify under the same proof while producing different bridge behavior. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
