# Q3568: new: An OAuth begin whose `is_online` depends on `user_session_expec...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`shop`, `return_to`, `host`, `top_level`, `embedded`, and the Referer header) reach `new / create / authenticate / start_install / start_oauth` in app/controllers/shopify_app/sessions_controller.rb via GET/POST /login (public, unauthenticated), supplying an OAuth begin whose `is_online` depends on `user_session_expected?` -> `shop_session` lookup on an attacker shop param, so that the install/OAuth target store must be the sanitized, attacker-independent shop, and return_to same-origin is violated, leading to OAuth flow initiated against an attacker-chosen store / open redirect on login? Specifically confirm that the derived shop/user/signature equals the canonical Shopify-asserted value for every input.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/sessions_controller.rb — `new / create / authenticate / start_install / start_oauth`
- Entrypoint: GET/POST /login (public, unauthenticated)
- Attacker controls: `shop`, `return_to`, `host`, `top_level`, `embedded`, and the Referer header — specifically an OAuth begin whose `is_online` depends on `user_session_expected?` -> `shop_session` lookup on an attacker shop param.
- Exploit idea: Compare the value the gem derives from the attacker input against the value Shopify actually signed/asserted.
- Invariant to test: the install/OAuth target store must be the sanitized, attacker-independent shop, and return_to same-origin
- Expected Immunefi impact: OAuth flow initiated against an attacker-chosen store / open redirect on login (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: differential test: feed the crafted input to the parsing/verification method and diff derived vs. canonical shop/user/signature.
