# Q1968: shopify_id_token: A token with a far-future `exp` combined with `jwt_expire_at`'s...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the Authorization header, the `id_token` URL param, and the JWT body) reach `shopify_id_token / jwt_payload / jwt_shopify_domain` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/with_shopify_id_token.rb via any request to a controller including WithShopifyIdToken (auth, CSRF, ensure_authenticated_links), supplying a token with a far-future `exp` combined with `jwt_expire_at`'s 5s skew to extend usable lifetime, so that choosing header vs param must not let an attacker supply a second, weaker token is violated, leading to session confusion / auth bypass? Specifically confirm that the error/rescue branch fails closed and leaks no token or secret.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/with_shopify_id_token.rb — `shopify_id_token / jwt_payload / jwt_shopify_domain`
- Entrypoint: any request to a controller including WithShopifyIdToken (auth, CSRF, ensure_authenticated_links)
- Attacker controls: the Authorization header, the `id_token` URL param, and the JWT body — specifically a token with a far-future `exp` combined with `jwt_expire_at`'s 5s skew to extend usable lifetime.
- Exploit idea: Force the rescued/exception branch and confirm it fails closed without leaking secrets or granting a session.
- Invariant to test: choosing header vs param must not let an attacker supply a second, weaker token
- Expected Immunefi impact: session confusion / auth bypass (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: error-injection test asserting the rescue branch yields no session, no token, and no secret in the response/log.
