# Q2096: get_connection_stake writeback ordering

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `get_connection_stake` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one unstaked client with connection identifiers, certificate/pubkey choices, source-ip reuse, and connection churn timing such that writes can land in a different order than the logic assumed when computing fees, locks, or state deltas, breaking the invariant that writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/nonblocking/quic.rs::get_connection_stake
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one unstaked client
- Attacker controls: connection identifiers, certificate/pubkey choices, source-IP reuse, and connection churn timing
- Exploit idea: search for ordering dependencies that break under batching or CPI
- Invariant to test: writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace write order and derived counters under multi-instruction, multi-CPI transactions
