# Q3195: WombatBribeManager.vote - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, where because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Assuming the pool the attacker voted for has been deactivated so unvote reverts, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `totalVlMgpInVote` and `sum of userTotalVotedInVlmgp over all voters` via `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)`, breaking the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates and producing Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the pool the attacker voted for has been deactivated so unvote reverts.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `totalVlMgpInVote` must stay reconciled with `sum of userTotalVotedInVlmgp over all voters`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries) under the pool the attacker voted for has been deactivated so unvote reverts, asserting on every row that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates.
