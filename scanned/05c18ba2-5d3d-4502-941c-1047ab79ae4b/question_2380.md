# Q2380: uint-to-list-u64 via collateral-remove: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the set of assets held reach `uint-to-list-u64` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it expands a bitmap into a 64-element list, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80` -> `uint-to-list-u64`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `uint-to-list-u64` expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
