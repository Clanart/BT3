# Q3502: sanitize_and_convert_to_compute_budget_limits panics on attacker-reachable input (compute_budget_instruction_details.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `sanitize_and_convert_to_compute_budget_limits` in `compute-budget-instruction/src/compute_budget_instruction_details.rs` with a nested structure with an attacker-chosen depth and element count, and reach an unchecked unwrap, slice index, or assertion inside `sanitize_and_convert_to_compute_budget_limits`, so that the invariant "No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `compute-budget-instruction/src/compute_budget_instruction_details.rs` -> `sanitize_and_convert_to_compute_budget_limits()` (around line 101)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a nested structure with an attacker-chosen depth and element count
- Exploit idea: Reach `sanitize_and_convert_to_compute_budget_limits` with input that trips an unwrap, slice index, `expect`, division, or debug assertion, aborting the process on every node that replays the block.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz `sanitize_and_convert_to_compute_budget_limits` with `cargo fuzz`/proptest over its attacker-controlled arguments; assert no panic, only `Result::Err`.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft bytecode, ELF metadata, precompile data, or zk proof input that panics, aborts, infinite-loops, or exhausts memory inside the VM and halts every validator.
