# Q804: NewDynamicFeeChecker - Negative Maxpriorityprice Extension Reaches Priority Calculation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `Cosmos tx dynamic-fee checker with EVM fee market params` while controlling `fee cap` and `tip cap`, under the precondition that the transaction consumes near its gas limit but remains valid, drive `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas` in `ante/evm/fee_checker.go::NewDynamicFeeChecker` so that negative MaxPriorityPrice extension reaches priority calculation, violating the invariant that fees deducted, gas consumed, refunds, and fee collector balance must net to the EVM execution result, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `ante/evm/fee_checker.go::NewDynamicFeeChecker`
- Entrypoint: `Cosmos tx dynamic-fee checker with EVM fee market params`
- Attacker controls: `fee cap`, `tip cap`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: negative MaxPriorityPrice extension reaches priority calculation through `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas`.
- Invariant to test: fees deducted, gas consumed, refunds, and fee collector balance must net to the EVM execution result.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: construct a contract harness that performs nested CALL/CREATE/SELFDESTRUCT/revert and compare bank keeper balances with StateDB balances.
