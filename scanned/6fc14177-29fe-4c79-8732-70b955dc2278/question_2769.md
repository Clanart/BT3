# Q2769: NEAR lock_tokens_if_needed one inbound event spawns multiple outbound obligations via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `internal helper reached from public init/finalize/fast paths` and then replay or reorder the complementary outbound or inbound bridge leg so that `near/omni-bridge/src/token_lock.rs::lock_tokens_if_needed` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `one inbound event spawns multiple outbound obligations` under locks bridge liquidity only when the token origin chain differs from the chosen chain and amount is nonzero, violating `lock accounting must not skip a real collateral obligation or lock the wrong asset/chain tuple for one cross-chain event`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/token_lock.rs::lock_tokens_if_needed`
- Entrypoint: `internal helper reached from public init/finalize/fast paths`
- Attacker controls: token id, chain kind interpreted as destination, and amount
- Exploit idea: Focus on forward-to-other-chain branches and fast-transfer substitution where an inbound event becomes a new pending transfer. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: lock accounting must not skip a real collateral obligation or lock the wrong asset/chain tuple for one cross-chain event
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Track value and replay state across both the inbound leg and the forwarded leg and assert that one source event cannot increase total outstanding claims. Then replay or reorder the complementary outbound or inbound bridge leg and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
