# Q3395: Break reimbursement recoverability in create_kickoff_not_finalized_txhandler

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with crafted the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` so `create_kickoff_not_finalized_txhandler` moves the protocol past the point where reimbursement should remain recoverable, leaving the operator signature set attached to a deposit inconsistent with the assumption that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, and leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/builder/transaction/operator_reimburse.rs::create_kickoff_not_finalized_txhandler
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: move bridge state forward while reimbursement/slashability stays tied to older state
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
