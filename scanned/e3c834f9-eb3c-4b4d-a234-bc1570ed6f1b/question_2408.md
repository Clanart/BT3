# Q2408: flush_accounts_cache read-only cache incoherence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `flush_accounts_cache` by submit transactions that touch many writable accounts and then query them immediately with many-account write bursts, slot churn, and immediate read-after-write rpcs so that read-only caching can return a version that writable/runtime paths would reject as stale, breaking the invariant that read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::flush_accounts_cache
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that touch many writable accounts and then query them immediately
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts, slot churn, and immediate read-after-write RPCs
- Exploit idea: diff read-only and runtime-visible answers for the same account
- Invariant to test: read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare read-only cache results to direct runtime/bank reads after writes
