# Q2519: add_root_and_flush_write_cache stale cache replay

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `add_root_and_flush_write_cache` by submit transactions that write many accounts near root transitions with many-account write bursts plus immediate root/read churn so that stale cached account content can outlive the storage or bank state that later logic expects, breaking the invariant that caches must not serve account data from an impossible slot/state combination and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::add_root_and_flush_write_cache
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that write many accounts near root transitions
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts plus immediate root/read churn
- Exploit idea: read an impossible old value after the canonical state has changed
- Invariant to test: caches must not serve account data from an impossible slot/state combination
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race rewrites and immediate reads, then diff cache-derived results against storage and bank views
