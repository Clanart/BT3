# Q1028: NEAR process_fin_transfer_to_near asset-branch confusion on finalization through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `internal path reached from public `fin_transfer`` with control over recipient account, predecessor account, transfer message, storage-deposit actions, fast-transfer status, and lock actions and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::process_fin_transfer_to_near` from the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `asset-branch confusion on finalization` attack class because marks the transfer finalised, optionally redirects payout to the fast-transfer relayer, checks storage-deposit actions for recipient and fee recipients, unlocks tokens, sends tokens, and mints fee tokens in the callback, violating `Near-side finalization must never misroute recipient funds, fee funds, or lock state across storage setup, fast-transfer substitution, and callback resolution`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::process_fin_transfer_to_near`
- Entrypoint: `internal path reached from public `fin_transfer``
- Attacker controls: recipient account, predecessor account, transfer message, storage-deposit actions, fast-transfer status, and lock actions
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: Near-side finalization must never misroute recipient funds, fee funds, or lock state across storage setup, fast-transfer substitution, and callback resolution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::process_fin_transfer_to_near` and the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping after every branch.
