# Q5400: normalize via collateral-remove: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `normalize` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:576) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it divides by `(pow u10 decimals)` only AFTER multiplying amount by price, making the protocol's USD unit a whole dollar, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:576` -> `normalize`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `normalize` divides by `(pow u10 decimals)` only AFTER multiplying amount by price, making the protocol's USD unit a whole dollar. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `normalize` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
