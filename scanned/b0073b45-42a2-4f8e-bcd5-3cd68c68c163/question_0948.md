# Q948: PublicAPI.SendRawTransaction - Fee Cap Accepted At Api But Charged Differently In Execution

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a signed raw Ethereum transaction through `public JSON-RPC eth_sendRawTransaction` while controlling `gasPrice/gasFeeCap/gasTipCap` and `nonce`, under the precondition that the transaction is accepted by public RPC fee-cap checks, drive `RPC RLP decode -> FromSignedEthereumTx -> ValidateBasic -> BuildTx -> broadcastTx` in `rpc/namespaces/ethereum/eth/api.go::PublicAPI.SendRawTransaction` so that fee cap accepted at API but charged differently in execution, violating the invariant that RPC admission must not alter fee, nonce, or tx type before consensus execution, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/namespaces/ethereum/eth/api.go::PublicAPI.SendRawTransaction`
- Entrypoint: `public JSON-RPC eth_sendRawTransaction`
- Attacker controls: `gasPrice/gasFeeCap/gasTipCap`, `nonce`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: fee cap accepted at API but charged differently in execution through `RPC RLP decode -> FromSignedEthereumTx -> ValidateBasic -> BuildTx -> broadcastTx`.
- Invariant to test: RPC admission must not alter fee, nonce, or tx type before consensus execution.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: force the edge value at uint64/uint256/sdk.Int boundaries and assert no smaller debit, larger refund, or supply change occurs.
