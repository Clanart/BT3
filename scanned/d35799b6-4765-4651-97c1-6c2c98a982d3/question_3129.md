# Q3129: calc-principal-ratio-reduction via deposit: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling `min-out`, drive `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191) — which reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191` -> `calc-principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Reach it through `deposit` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` touches, run `deposit` with `min-out`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
