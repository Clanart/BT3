# Q5565: convert-to-assets-preview via liquidate-redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `convert-to-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317) — which prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview` — to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, breaking the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317` -> `convert-to-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `convert-to-assets-preview` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
