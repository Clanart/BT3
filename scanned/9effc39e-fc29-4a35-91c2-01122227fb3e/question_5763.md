# Q5763: WombatBribeManager.claimBribeFor - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
In wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `claimBribeFor(address[] lps, address _for)` while the bribe contract for the pool registers more than one reward token, and drive `getVoteForLp(lp) from the Wombat voter` out of agreement with `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` - breaking the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates - for Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `claimBribeFor(address[] lps, address _for)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `claimBribeFor(address[] lps, address _for)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _for (any victim) and the lp array
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the bribe contract for the pool registers more than one reward token.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `getVoteForLp(lp) from the Wombat voter` must stay reconciled with `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `claimBribeFor(address[] lps, address _for)` sequence atomically under the bribe contract for the pool registers more than one reward token, asserting at the end that `getVoteForLp(lp) from the Wombat voter` still equals `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
