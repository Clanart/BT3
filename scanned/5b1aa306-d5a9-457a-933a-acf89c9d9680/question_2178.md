# Q2178: next-liquidity-index via call-ststx-ratio: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `next-liquidity-index` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
