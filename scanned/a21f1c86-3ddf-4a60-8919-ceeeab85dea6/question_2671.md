# Q2671: remove zero-lamport resurrection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads during account churn with read-after-delete and recreate patterns against the same accounts so that dead or zero-lamport accounts can survive or reappear because cleanup and load paths disagree, breaking the invariant that closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs::remove
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads during account churn
- Attacker controls: read-after-delete and recreate patterns against the same accounts
- Exploit idea: look for stale dead-account visibility after close/recreate churn
- Invariant to test: closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: close and recreate the same attacker-controlled account shape repeatedly
