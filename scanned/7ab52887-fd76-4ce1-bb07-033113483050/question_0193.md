# Q193: NEAR process_fin_transfer_to_other_chain replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `internal path reached from public `fin_transfer` for non-Near recipients` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::process_fin_transfer_to_other_chain` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly` under marks the transfer finalised, unlocks origin-side liquidity, re-locks destination-side fee or amount, optionally sends the fast-transfer payout to a relayer, or stores a new pending transfer for the next chain, violating `cross-chain forwarding must never let one verified inbound event release value locally and also create a second valid outbound claim with inconsistent lock accounting`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::process_fin_transfer_to_other_chain`
- Entrypoint: `internal path reached from public `fin_transfer` for non-Near recipients`
- Attacker controls: recipient chain, predecessor account, transfer message, fast-transfer status, and token origin chain
- Exploit idea: Stress replay-protection state keyed only by nonce, transfer id, or bitmap position across branches and chains. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: cross-chain forwarding must never let one verified inbound event release value locally and also create a second valid outbound claim with inconsistent lock accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Replay valid proofs/signatures with altered non-economic fields and assert that only the exact originally-settled event is rejected as already used. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
