# Q342: NEAR fin_transfer entry replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public `fin_transfer` proof-submission flow` with control over proof bytes, source chain selection, storage-deposit actions, attached deposit, and ordering of storage actions and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fin_transfer` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly` attack class because verifies a proof through the configured prover, optionally prepays storage for recipient and fee accounts, then dispatches to `fin_transfer_callback`, violating `one valid inbound proof must settle exactly once, on the correct asset and branch, without letting storage preparation alter what economic event is finalized`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fin_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public `fin_transfer` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, storage-deposit actions, attached deposit, and ordering of storage actions
- Exploit idea: Stress replay-protection state keyed only by nonce, transfer id, or bitmap position across branches and chains. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: one valid inbound proof must settle exactly once, on the correct asset and branch, without letting storage preparation alter what economic event is finalized
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Replay valid proofs/signatures with altered non-economic fields and assert that only the exact originally-settled event is rejected as already used. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fin_transfer` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
