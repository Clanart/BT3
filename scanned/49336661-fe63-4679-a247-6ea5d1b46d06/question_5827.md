# Q5827: linear-interpolate via call-ststx-ratio: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Can an unprivileged caller of `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), by choosing whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `call-ststx-ratio` with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, then read `linear-interpolate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
