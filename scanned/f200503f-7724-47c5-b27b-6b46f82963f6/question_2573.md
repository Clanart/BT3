# Q2573: NEAR public transfer-message reads same fee collectible twice at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public off-chain coordination reads for pending transfers` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::get_transfer_message / get_transfer_message_storage` violate `publicly-observable pending state must remain canonical so external actors cannot be induced to sign or relay the wrong transfer` in the `same fee collectible twice` attack class because returns stored pending-transfer records that off-chain actors use to build signatures, fees, and proofs becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::get_transfer_message / get_transfer_message_storage`
- Entrypoint: `public off-chain coordination reads for pending transfers`
- Attacker controls: transfer id choice and timing relative to sign/claim/finalize callbacks
- Exploit idea: Target pending-transfer cleanup, fast-transfer removal, and replay protection around fee-claim proofs. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: publicly-observable pending state must remain canonical so external actors cannot be induced to sign or relay the wrong transfer
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Claim once, then replay or mutate non-economic proof fields and assert that no second claim succeeds or blocks unrelated transfers. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
