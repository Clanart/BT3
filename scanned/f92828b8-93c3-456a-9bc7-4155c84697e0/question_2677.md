# Q2677: Accept wrong proof/network context in citrea_sequencer_commitment_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes through user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync so `citrea_sequencer_commitment_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the L1/L2 height pair treated as finalized and safe to bridge against and breaking the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/tests.rs::citrea_sequencer_commitment_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
