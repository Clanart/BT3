# Q1472: process_and_record_transactions signature-cache inconsistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_and_record_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transaction batches, conflicting write sets, duplicate signatures, fee-payer edge cases, and cpi-heavy payloads such that a signature can become cached or cleared in a way that disagrees with actual execution or rollback outcome, breaking the invariant that signature caches must reflect executed and committed reality only and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/banking_stage/consumer.rs::process_and_record_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transaction batches, conflicting write sets, duplicate signatures, fee-payer edge cases, and CPI-heavy payloads
- Exploit idea: look for cache mutations on paths that later fail or retry
- Invariant to test: signature caches must reflect executed and committed reality only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace signature-cache updates while forcing retries, conflicts, and late failures
