# Q4960: WombatPoolHelperV2.deposit - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Starting from a state where the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, can an unprivileged EOA use `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` to leave `this.balance(msg.sender)` inconsistent with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`, violating the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value and extracting Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`: constrain the setup so that the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, fuzz the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity), and assert after every call that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value.
