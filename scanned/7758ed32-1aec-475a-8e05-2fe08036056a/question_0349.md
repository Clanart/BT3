# Q349: hash accept invalid consensus data via public key and signature byte encodings

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker provide serialized public keys/signatures targeting `hash` in `crates/chia-secp/src/secp256k1/public_key.rs` with public key and signature byte encodings at a fork-height or boundary-value activation point make chia_rs accept invalid consensus data, violating the invariant that aggregate signatures prove every required message/public-key pair, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Consensus-valid spend, block generator, proof, or block record path can mint, burn, steal, double-spend, or mis-account Chia coins/rewards/fees?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-secp/src/secp256k1/public_key.rs:14` / `hash`
- Entrypoint: provide serialized public keys/signatures
- Attacker controls: public key and signature byte encodings
- Exploit idea: Drive `hash` through its public caller path using public key and signature byte encodings; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: aggregate signatures prove every required message/public-key pair
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Consensus-valid spend, block generator, proof, or block record path can mint, burn, steal, double-spend, or mis-account Chia coins/rewards/fees
- Fast validation: compare aggregate_verify with independent pairings.
