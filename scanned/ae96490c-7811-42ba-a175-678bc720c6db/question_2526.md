# Q2526: add_root_and_flush_write_cache root-flush visibility gap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `add_root_and_flush_write_cache` by submit transactions that write many accounts near root transitions with many-account write bursts plus immediate root/read churn so that root advancement and flush state can diverge long enough for readers to observe impossible account histories, breaking the invariant that root visibility and flushed persistence must not diverge in externally observable ways and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::add_root_and_flush_write_cache
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that write many accounts near root transitions
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts plus immediate root/read churn
- Exploit idea: search for split-brain visibility between rooted and flushed state
- Invariant to test: root visibility and flushed persistence must not diverge in externally observable ways
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: read the same pubkey during root movement and compare rooted versus cached answers
