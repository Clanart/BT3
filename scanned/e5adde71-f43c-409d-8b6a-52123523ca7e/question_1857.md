# Q1857: create_memory_region_of_account queue fairness break

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `create_memory_region_of_account` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with account layouts, duplicate writable aliases, realloc paths, and nested cpi writes such that attacker-chosen transactions make this function occupy shared scheduling resources long enough to starve cheaper work, breaking the invariant that one heavy transaction shape must not monopolize shared scheduling resources and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/serialization.rs::create_memory_region_of_account
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: account layouts, duplicate writable aliases, realloc paths, and nested CPI writes
- Exploit idea: measure unfair occupancy rather than raw throughput
- Invariant to test: one heavy transaction shape must not monopolize shared scheduling resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: replay one heavy shape alongside cheap transfers and compare scheduling latency
