# Q2974: parse accept invalid consensus data via JSON dictionary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker round-trip macro-generated protocol objects targeting `parse` in `crates/chia_streamable_macro/src/lib.rs` with JSON dictionary values at a fork-height or boundary-value activation point make chia_rs accept invalid consensus data, violating the invariant that generated parse/stream/hash code covers all fields in order, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia_streamable_macro/src/lib.rs:271` / `parse`
- Entrypoint: round-trip macro-generated protocol objects
- Attacker controls: JSON dictionary values
- Exploit idea: Drive `parse` through its public caller path using JSON dictionary values; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: generated parse/stream/hash code covers all fields in order
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption
- Fast validation: assert trusted parse is only used after a canonical parse boundary.
