# Q5562: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address and force `pid cached at construction` apart from `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, breaking the invariant that the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal for Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, have the attacker run `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `pid cached at construction` versus `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
