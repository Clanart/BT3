# Q2521: uint-to-list-u64 via liquidate: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `min-collateral-expected`, drive `uint-to-list-u64` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80) — which expands a bitmap into a 64-element list — to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, breaking the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80` -> `uint-to-list-u64`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `uint-to-list-u64` expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Reach it through `liquidate` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `min-collateral-expected`, then read `uint-to-list-u64` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
