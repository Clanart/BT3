# Q933: Starknet normalize decimals helper native versus wrapped registration confusion via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public deploy path through `deploy_token`` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::_normalizeDecimals` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `native versus wrapped registration confusion` under caps decimals to Starknet’s maximum supported value before bridge-token deployment, violating `decimal normalization must not let a wrapped token represent more or less claimable value than the source asset actually backs`?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::_normalizeDecimals`
- Entrypoint: `public deploy path through `deploy_token``
- Attacker controls: declared remote decimals and all downstream amount conversions that assume the capped value
- Exploit idea: Target vault-existence checks, deployed-token caches, origin-chain inference, and custom-minter registration. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: decimal normalization must not let a wrapped token represent more or less claimable value than the source asset actually backs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Flip each classification predicate around existing mappings and assert that deployment and later settlement always preserve the same custody model. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
