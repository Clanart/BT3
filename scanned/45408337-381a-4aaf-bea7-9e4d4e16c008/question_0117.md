# Q117: execute_transactions meta-transaction auth bypass in execution/execute_transactions.cairo (batch-ordering edge)

## Question
Can a normal Starknet user submitting invoke, declare, deploy_account, or L1-handler-triggering inputs use transaction calldata, nonce selection, resource bounds and tip, signature material accepted by the sender's own account contract, gas/resource edge cases to make `execute_transactions` in `crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/execute_transactions.cairo` use the meta-transaction or version-0 compatibility path to bypass an authorization, nonce, or fee assumption that holds in the normal invoke path around account nonce and replay protection, so that honest StarkNet OS execution commits, emits, or accepts an attacker-favorable result that reaches direct loss of funds? Can the issue appear only when the attacker repeats or reorders otherwise valid actions inside the same block or state diff?

## Target
- File/function: crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/execute_transactions.cairo:36 :: execute_transactions
- Entrypoint: normal Starknet user submitting invoke, declare, deploy_account, or L1-handler-triggering inputs
- Attacker controls: transaction calldata, nonce selection, resource bounds and tip, signature material accepted by the sender's own account contract, gas/resource edge cases
- Exploit idea: rebind signature, caller, or version semantics so an inner call executes with weaker checks than the outer transaction context implies while this function is handling account nonce and replay protection. Exploit repeated valid actions, cross-transaction ordering, or same-block batching to surface the mismatch.
- Invariant to test: meta-transaction compatibility must not weaken nonce, caller, signature, or fee invariants compared with the normal user-facing invoke path Reordering or repeating otherwise valid public actions within one block must not change the safety invariant beyond the intended deterministic state transition.
- Expected bounty impact: Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: exercise version-0, meta-tx, and nested-call combinations around this function, then assert no accepted trace can do something that the equivalent normal invoke path would reject Write a same-block differential test that permutes the attacker-controlled actions and assert there is no extra accepted state, message, or accounting outcome.
