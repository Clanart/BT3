# Q3091: EVM BridgeToken burn global asset-conservation invariant break at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public outbound-side burn reachable only through bridge-owner calls` with boundary-controlled inputs covering zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/BridgeToken.sol::burn` violate `wrapped-token burns must always stay synchronized with emitted bridge events so users cannot redeem, migrate, or replay burned value twice` in the `global asset-conservation invariant break` attack class because owner-only burn is the bridge’s canonical way to destroy wrapped supply before emitting outbound claims becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/BridgeToken.sol::burn`
- Entrypoint: `public outbound-side burn reachable only through bridge-owner calls`
- Attacker controls: account and amount chosen by the bridge
- Exploit idea: Treat the target as one part of a multi-leg conservation system rather than an isolated bug class. Concentrate on zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values.
- Invariant to test: wrapped-token burns must always stay synchronized with emitted bridge events so users cannot redeem, migrate, or replay burned value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Build an invariant test that sums principal, fees, wrapped supply, custody, and lock rows across all affected branches and assert conservation after every step. Sweep boundary values for zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
