# Q0923: vault-socialize-debt via liquidate: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`vault-socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216) routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:216` -> `vault-socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `vault-socialize-debt` routes a scaled write-down to one of six vaults. Reach it through `liquidate` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
