# Q2134: spawn_simple_qos_server alias lock divergence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `spawn_simple_qos_server` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one client with connection counts, packet pacing, payload sizes, and source-ip churn timing such that duplicated writable/read-only aliases and ALT-expanded account lists make the lock view here differ from the later execution or commit view, breaking the invariant that a transaction must have one canonical writable/read-only account view from sanitize through commit and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/quic.rs::spawn_simple_qos_server
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one client
- Attacker controls: connection counts, packet pacing, payload sizes, and source-IP churn timing
- Exploit idea: turn one logical account set into two inconsistent internal views so conflict detection is bypassed or retries spin forever
- Invariant to test: a transaction must have one canonical writable/read-only account view from sanitize through commit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace the lock set, loaded account set, and committed writes for ALT-heavy duplicated-account transactions
