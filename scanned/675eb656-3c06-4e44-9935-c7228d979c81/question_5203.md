# Q5203: iter-lookup-debt via supply-collateral-add: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`iter-lookup-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218) skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218` -> `iter-lookup-debt`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, then read `iter-lookup-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
