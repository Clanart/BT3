# Q2761: load_latest notification filter overload

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_latest` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads for hot accounts under continuous rewrites with same-pubkey rewrites across slots with immediate reads so that attacker-chosen notification filters force more post-filter work than the subscriber semantics imply, breaking the invariant that notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::load_latest
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads for hot accounts under continuous rewrites
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey rewrites across slots with immediate reads
- Exploit idea: use valid subscription filters as the amplifier
- Invariant to test: notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: compare pre-filter candidate counts to delivered-notification counts
