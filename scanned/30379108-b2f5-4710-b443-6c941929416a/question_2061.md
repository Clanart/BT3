# Q2061: handle_chunks ALT account explosion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `handle_chunks` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one client with quic chunk boundaries, packet counts, certificate/pubkey choices, and transaction payload sizes such that address lookup tables make this function handle a much larger effective account surface than the early admission logic prices, breaking the invariant that versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/nonblocking/quic.rs::handle_chunks
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one client
- Attacker controls: QUIC chunk boundaries, packet counts, certificate/pubkey choices, and transaction payload sizes
- Exploit idea: use legal ALT expansion to amplify load, lock, or verification work
- Invariant to test: versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: benchmark identical logic with and without ALT expansion
