# Q3217: BaseRewardPoolV2.getRewards - _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles

## Question
In rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol, _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Starting from a state where a reward-manager queueNewRewards transaction is pending in the mempool, can an unprivileged EOA use `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` to leave `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` inconsistent with `earned(account,_rewardToken)`, violating the invariant that a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered and extracting High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec / multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Precondition: a reward-manager queueNewRewards transaction is pending in the mempool.
- Invariant to test: a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered; concretely, `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` must stay reconciled with `earned(account,_rewardToken)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` sequence atomically under a reward-manager queueNewRewards transaction is pending in the mempool, asserting at the end that `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` still equals `earned(account,_rewardToken)` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
