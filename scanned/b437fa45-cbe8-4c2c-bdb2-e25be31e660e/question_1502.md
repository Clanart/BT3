# Q1502: Leave reusable partial state in verify_disprove_conditions

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker force a partial failure around the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` and then resume public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `verify_disprove_conditions` continues from stale intermediate state, causing the reimbursement path that must remain slashable and recoverable to diverge from the canonical bridge context and breaking the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/verifier.rs::verify_disprove_conditions
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure around the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` and then resume under changed state
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
