# Q3407: Break reimbursement recoverability in sign_taproot_pubkey_spend_tx_with_sighash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with crafted the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` so `sign_taproot_pubkey_spend_tx_with_sighash` moves the protocol past the point where reimbursement should remain recoverable, leaving the deposit-to-move-tx binding inconsistent with the assumption that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, and leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/actor.rs::sign_taproot_pubkey_spend_tx_with_sighash
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: move bridge state forward while reimbursement/slashability stays tied to older state
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
