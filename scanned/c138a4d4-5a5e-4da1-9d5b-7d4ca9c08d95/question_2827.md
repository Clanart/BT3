# Q2827: remove_slots_le slot-cache latest drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove_slots_le` by submit transactions that churn the same pubkeys across old and new slots with same-pubkey churn across slots plus cleanup pressure so that latest-account selection can choose the wrong slot under same-pubkey churn, breaking the invariant that latest-account resolution must pick the true latest visible slot and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::remove_slots_le
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that churn the same pubkeys across old and new slots
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey churn across slots plus cleanup pressure
- Exploit idea: target multiple nearby slot writes to one pubkey
- Invariant to test: latest-account resolution must pick the true latest visible slot
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: rewrite one account across nearby slots and verify which version low-rate reads observe
