# Q3114: filter_block_result_txs watcher leak on disconnect

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_block_result_txs` by use in-scope block subscriptions and hot block contents with block subscription filters, detail levels, and hot block streams so that disconnect/unsubscribe races leave watcher state or queued notifications behind, breaking the invariant that watcher teardown must reclaim all state promptly and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_block_result_txs
- Entrypoint: use in-scope block subscriptions and hot block contents
- Attacker controls: block subscription filters, detail levels, and hot block streams
- Exploit idea: stress teardown paths
- Invariant to test: watcher teardown must reclaim all state promptly
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: rapidly connect/disconnect and compare live watcher counts before and after
