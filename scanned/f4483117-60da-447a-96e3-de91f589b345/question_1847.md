# Q1847: Leave reusable partial state in insert_txid_to_block

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker force a partial failure around the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context and then resume public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `insert_txid_to_block` continues from stale intermediate state, causing the reimbursement path that must remain slashable and recoverable to diverge from the canonical bridge context and breaking the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/bitcoin_syncer.rs::insert_txid_to_block
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure around the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context and then resume under changed state
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
