# Q2145: EthSignerExtractionAdapter.GetSigners - First Message Signer Controls Priority For Later Ethereum Messages

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit, replace, reorder, or batch pending transactions through `mempool signer extraction for Ethereum extension-option txs` while controlling `broadcast fallback` and `multi-message tx`, under the precondition that the tx contains multiple messages but one extracted signer, drive `PendingTransactions -> replacement/resubmission -> CheckTx locked admission -> proposal inclusion` in `evmd/signer.go::EthSignerExtractionAdapter.GetSigners` so that first-message signer controls priority for later Ethereum messages, violating the invariant that fallback broadcast must not bypass signature or fee checks, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `evmd/signer.go::EthSignerExtractionAdapter.GetSigners`
- Entrypoint: `mempool signer extraction for Ethereum extension-option txs`
- Attacker controls: `broadcast fallback`, `multi-message tx`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: first-message signer controls priority for later Ethereum messages through `PendingTransactions -> replacement/resubmission -> CheckTx locked admission -> proposal inclusion`.
- Invariant to test: fallback broadcast must not bypass signature or fee checks.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: build a two-message Cosmos tx fixture and assert ante, execution, refund, and receipt invariants after FinalizeBlock.
