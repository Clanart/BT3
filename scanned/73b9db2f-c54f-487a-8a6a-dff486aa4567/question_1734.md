# Q1734: BaseRewardPoolV2.updateFor - totalStaked and balanceOf read from different sources

## Question
Consider rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol, where totalStaked() reads IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(operator) while balanceOf(account) reads IMasterMagpie(operator).stakingInfo(stakingToken, account), so a token sent directly to MasterMagpie, or a vlMGP-style credit made with no transfer, permanently desynchronises numerator and denominator. Assuming the staking token is an 18-decimal Wombat receipt token and totalStaked() is far above 1e18, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` and `userRewardPerTokenPaid[_rewardToken][account]` via `updateFor(address _account)`, breaking the invariant that sum over all accounts of balanceOf(account) must equal totalStaked() and producing Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol -> `updateFor(address _account)` (mechanism: totalStaked and balanceOf read from different sources)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `updateFor(address _account)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted
- Exploit idea: totalStaked() reads IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(operator) while balanceOf(account) reads IMasterMagpie(operator).stakingInfo(stakingToken, account), so a token sent directly to MasterMagpie, or a vlMGP-style credit made with no transfer, permanently desynchronises numerator and denominator. Precondition: the staking token is an 18-decimal Wombat receipt token and totalStaked() is far above 1e18.
- Invariant to test: sum over all accounts of balanceOf(account) must equal totalStaked(); concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` must stay reconciled with `userRewardPerTokenPaid[_rewardToken][account]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the staking token is an 18-decimal Wombat receipt token and totalStaked() is far above 1e18, have the attacker run `updateFor(address _account)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` versus `userRewardPerTokenPaid[_rewardToken][account]` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
