# Q0544: try_create arithmetic overflows on reachable values (sdk_transactions.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `try_create` in `runtime-transaction/src/runtime_transaction/sdk_transactions.rs` with a zero-lamport or exactly-rent-exempt-minus-one account, and make the arithmetic in `try_create` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime-transaction/src/runtime_transaction/sdk_transactions.rs` -> `try_create()` (around line 78)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a zero-lamport or exactly-rent-exempt-minus-one account
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `try_create` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `try_create` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft bytecode, ELF metadata, precompile data, or zk proof input that panics, aborts, infinite-loops, or exhausts memory inside the VM and halts every validator.
