# Q18: Keeper.validateAuthorization - Zero Chain Id Authorization Replay Across Cronos Compatible Chains

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit an EIP-7702 SetCode transaction through `EIP-7702 authorization validation during transaction execution` while controlling `authority account code` and `AuthList nil-vs-empty`, under the precondition that duplicate authorization tuples for one authority appear in the same transaction, drive `ApplyMessageWithConfig -> applyAuthorization -> applyDurableAuthorization -> StateDB.Commit` in `x/evm/keeper/set_code_authorizations.go::Keeper.validateAuthorization` so that zero chain ID authorization replay across Cronos-compatible chains, violating the invariant that failed or skipped authorizations must not leave durable code or nonce changes, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/set_code_authorizations.go::Keeper.validateAuthorization`
- Entrypoint: `EIP-7702 authorization validation during transaction execution`
- Attacker controls: `authority account code`, `AuthList nil-vs-empty`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: zero chain ID authorization replay across Cronos-compatible chains through `ApplyMessageWithConfig -> applyAuthorization -> applyDurableAuthorization -> StateDB.Commit`.
- Invariant to test: failed or skipped authorizations must not leave durable code or nonce changes.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: run a local integration test that submits the crafted raw tx through JSON-RPC and compares committed state with direct keeper queries.
