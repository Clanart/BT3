# Q3999: redirect_to_login: A crafted Referer header so `referer_sanitized_shop_name` injec...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`return_to`, `shop`, `host`, the Referer header, and arbitrary extra query params) reach `redirect_to_login / return_to_url / login_url_params` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb via GET a protected action while unauthenticated (triggers redirect_to_login), supplying a crafted Referer header so `referer_sanitized_shop_name` injects an attacker shop into `login_url_params[:shop]`, so that return_to must resolve only to a same-origin path, never an external absolute URL is violated, leading to open redirect used to steal the id_token/host on the follow-up navigation? Specifically confirm that the security property holds for the whole generated input class, not just one example.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb — `redirect_to_login / return_to_url / login_url_params`
- Entrypoint: GET a protected action while unauthenticated (triggers redirect_to_login)
- Attacker controls: `return_to`, `shop`, `host`, the Referer header, and arbitrary extra query params — specifically a crafted Referer header so `referer_sanitized_shop_name` injects an attacker shop into `login_url_params[:shop]`.
- Exploit idea: State the security property as an invariant and check it over a generated range of related inputs.
- Invariant to test: return_to must resolve only to a same-origin path, never an external absolute URL
- Expected Immunefi impact: open redirect used to steal the id_token/host on the follow-up navigation (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: invariant/property test over generated inputs asserting the security property holds universally.
