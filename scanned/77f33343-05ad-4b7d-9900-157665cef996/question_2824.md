# Q2824: destroy: A `return_address` after logout reflecting attacker `shop`/`hos...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`shop`, `host`, the OAuth state cookie) reach `destroy / redirect_to_begin_oauth cookie` in app/controllers/shopify_app/sessions_controller.rb via GET /logout and the OAuth begin cookie set, supplying a `return_address` after logout reflecting attacker `shop`/`host` params, so that OAuth state/nonce must be unpredictable and bound to this browser only is violated, leading to OAuth CSRF / authorization-code interception (account takeover, not plain logout CSRF)? Specifically confirm that a wrong-secret or tampered artifact is always rejected before any side effect.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/sessions_controller.rb — `destroy / redirect_to_begin_oauth cookie`
- Entrypoint: GET /logout and the OAuth begin cookie set
- Attacker controls: `shop`, `host`, the OAuth state cookie — specifically a `return_address` after logout reflecting attacker `shop`/`host` params.
- Exploit idea: Run the exact flow with a deliberately-wrong secret/signature/token to prove verification actually rejects it.
- Invariant to test: OAuth state/nonce must be unpredictable and bound to this browser only
- Expected Immunefi impact: OAuth CSRF / authorization-code interception (account takeover, not plain logout CSRF) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: negative-control test asserting a wrong-secret/wrong-signature/tampered-token request is rejected with no side effect.
