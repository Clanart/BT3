# Q0373: MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec - lpSupply inflation by direct token donation

## Question
rewards/MasterMagpie.sol: _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Under the pool is the only one with a non-zero allocPoint so the whole mgpPerSec stream lands on it, is there an unprivileged sequence of `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)` that leaves `unClaimedMgp[_stakingToken][user]` unreconciled with `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].rewardDebt`, violates the invariant that MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply, and delivers High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: lpSupply inflation by direct token donation)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: both outer and inner arrays, so every reward-token address and its order
- Exploit idea: _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Precondition: the pool is the only one with a non-zero allocPoint so the whole mgpPerSec stream lands on it.
- Invariant to test: MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply; concretely, `unClaimedMgp[_stakingToken][user]` must stay reconciled with `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].rewardDebt`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the pool is the only one with a non-zero allocPoint so the whole mgpPerSec stream lands on it, call `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)`, and assert `unClaimedMgp[_stakingToken][user]` equals `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].rewardDebt` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
