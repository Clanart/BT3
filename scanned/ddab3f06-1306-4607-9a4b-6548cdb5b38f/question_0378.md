# Q0378: Verify: sound-zpoint via VerifyKZGProof [when/the]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call `Context.VerifyKZGProof` (arguments: blobCommitment, inputPointBytes, claimedValueBytes, kzgProof) with inputPointBytes decoding to a scalar equal to the trusted-setup secret's image so alpha-z vanishes, when the same element is expressed by two different valid encodings, so that the input point z is chosen so that [alpha - z]G2 becomes the identity or a low-order element, collapsing one pairing factor and letting a forged (claimedValue, quotient) pass, making the library use inconsistent values for `the PairingCheck outcome` and `a from-scratch pairing of the same operands` and breaking the invariant that Verify returns nil <=> the polynomial committed by the commitment evaluates to the claimed value at the input point? Verify this specifically both encodings must yield one decision, or one must be rejected, and assert `the PairingCheck outcome` equals `a from-scratch pairing of the same operands`.

## Target
- File/function: `internal/kzg/kzg_verify.go` -> `Verify`
- Entrypoint: `Context.VerifyKZGProof` (unprivileged; caller-authored bytes over the normal protocol path)
- Attacker controls: inputPointBytes decoding to a scalar equal to the trusted-setup secret's image so alpha-z vanishes
- Exploit idea: The input point z is chosen so that [alpha - z]G2 becomes the identity or a low-order element, collapsing one pairing factor and letting a forged (claimedValue, quotient) pass. Construct inputPointBytes decoding to a scalar equal to the trusted-setup secret's image so alpha-z vanishes and route it through `Context.VerifyKZGProof` into `Verify` (internal/kzg/kzg_verify.go); both encodings must yield one decision, or one must be rejected. The witness is the gap between `the PairingCheck outcome` and `a from-scratch pairing of the same operands`.
- Invariant to test: Verify returns nil <=> the polynomial committed by the commitment evaluates to the claimed value at the input point
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - a proof, blob, or cell batch is accepted that is not a true opening (forged data availability / consensus split), or out-of-subgroup / non-canonical bytes deserialize and then pass verification
- Fast validation: Write a `go test` in the root package that constructs the input with the embedded `NewContext4096Secure()` setup (or loads a vector from `tests/`), drives `Verify` in `internal/kzg/kzg_verify.go`, and asserts both sides of the invariant equality before and after the call; mock nothing, use only in-process calls.
