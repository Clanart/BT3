# Q424: execute_entry_point storage coherence break in execution/execute_entry_point.cairo (boundary-value edge)

## Question
Can a malicious Cairo contract reached from a valid user transaction, using attacker-chosen syscall inputs use selector, calldata length, nested call structure, gas/resource edge cases to make `execute_entry_point` in `crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/execute_entry_point.cairo` read or write storage under one key/value history but commit a different key/value history after nested execution or rollback around builtin-pointer soundness, so that honest StarkNet OS execution commits, emits, or accepts an attacker-favorable result that reaches direct loss of funds? Specifically, can boundary field values, empty/non-empty transitions, or zero-special-case branches trigger the discrepancy?

## Target
- File/function: crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/execute_entry_point.cairo:142 :: execute_entry_point
- Entrypoint: malicious Cairo contract reached from a valid user transaction, using attacker-chosen syscall inputs
- Attacker controls: selector, calldata length, nested call structure, gas/resource edge cases
- Exploit idea: separate the storage proof/value the OS caches from the value, key, or ordering later written into the state diff while this function is handling builtin-pointer soundness. Use attacker-chosen boundary values, zero sentinels, and empty/non-empty transitions to hit the sharp branch in this path.
- Invariant to test: for every accepted storage side effect, the same canonical key history must be reflected in the state diff, revert log, and final commitment Boundary values and zero-special-case handling must preserve the same security and accounting invariant as ordinary values.
- Expected bounty impact: Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: construct a contract that performs nested reads/writes and reverts around this function, then assert final storage diff, revert replay, and committed root all match the same key/value sequence Add a focused fuzz harness around zero, max-sized, empty, and single-element cases and assert the same invariant still holds.
