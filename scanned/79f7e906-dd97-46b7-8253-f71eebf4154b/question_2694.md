# Q2694: calc-multiplier-delta via call-ststx-ratio: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `calc-multiplier-delta` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
