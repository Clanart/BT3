# Q2740: is-healthy-with-mask via liquidate-redeem: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the redemption receiver reach `is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
