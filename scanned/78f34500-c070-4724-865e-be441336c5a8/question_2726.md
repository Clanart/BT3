# Q2726: accounts_cache.load root-flush visibility gap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by submit transactions plus immediate reads for recently changed accounts with same-pubkey churn plus immediate readback so that root advancement and flush state can diverge long enough for readers to observe impossible account histories, breaking the invariant that root visibility and flushed persistence must not diverge in externally observable ways and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::load
- Entrypoint: submit transactions plus immediate reads for recently changed accounts
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey churn plus immediate readback
- Exploit idea: search for split-brain visibility between rooted and flushed state
- Invariant to test: root visibility and flushed persistence must not diverge in externally observable ways
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: read the same pubkey during root movement and compare rooted versus cached answers
