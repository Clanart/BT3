# Q4181: mWOMSVBaseRewarder.getReward - forfeit erased by settling during cooldown

## Question
Note that in rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol, _calExpireForfeit() multiplies the pending amount by mWOMSV.getRewardablePercentWAD(_account), which stays at exactly 1e18 for the whole cooldown window, so a user who has already started their exit forfeits nothing. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` under the attacker locks one block before a known large settlement and unlocks one block after and force `balanceOf(account)` apart from `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`, breaking the invariant that the forfeit must reflect the lock commitment actually served, not the settlement instant the user chose for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: forfeit erased by settling during cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the settlement timing, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim and through the locker's unlock path
- Exploit idea: _calExpireForfeit() multiplies the pending amount by mWOMSV.getRewardablePercentWAD(_account), which stays at exactly 1e18 for the whole cooldown window, so a user who has already started their exit forfeits nothing. Precondition: the attacker locks one block before a known large settlement and unlocks one block after.
- Invariant to test: the forfeit must reflect the lock commitment actually served, not the settlement instant the user chose; concretely, `balanceOf(account)` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the attacker locks one block before a known large settlement and unlocks one block after, call `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`, and assert `balanceOf(account)` equals `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
