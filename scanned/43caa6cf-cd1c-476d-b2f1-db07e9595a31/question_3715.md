# Q3715: Keeper.validateAuthorization - Zero Chain Id Authorization Replay Across Cronos Compatible Chains

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit an EIP-7702 SetCode transaction through `EIP-7702 authorization validation during transaction execution` while controlling `authorization V/R/S` and `authority account code`, under the precondition that the EIP-7702 transaction later reverts or hits a post-hook failure, drive `ApplyMessageWithConfig -> applyAuthorization -> applyDurableAuthorization -> StateDB.Commit` in `x/evm/keeper/set_code_authorizations.go::Keeper.validateAuthorization` so that zero chain ID authorization replay across Cronos-compatible chains, violating the invariant that EIP-7702 may only mutate code/nonce for the recovered authority with a valid nonce and chain ID, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/set_code_authorizations.go::Keeper.validateAuthorization`
- Entrypoint: `EIP-7702 authorization validation during transaction execution`
- Attacker controls: `authorization V/R/S`, `authority account code`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: zero chain ID authorization replay across Cronos-compatible chains through `ApplyMessageWithConfig -> applyAuthorization -> applyDurableAuthorization -> StateDB.Commit`.
- Invariant to test: EIP-7702 may only mutate code/nonce for the recovered authority with a valid nonce and chain ID.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: construct a contract harness that performs nested CALL/CREATE/SELFDESTRUCT/revert and compare bank keeper balances with StateDB balances.
