# Q5726: MasterMagpie.multiclaimFor - safeApprove non-zero-allowance revert in _sendVlMGPFor

## Question
rewards/MasterMagpie.sol: _sendVlMGPFor() calls IERC20(mgp).safeApprove(address(vlmgp), _amount) without first zeroing the allowance, so any residue left by a partially-consuming lockFor permanently bricks every subsequent default-pool claim. Under the contract is paused so only emergencyWithdraw is reachable, is there an unprivileged sequence of `multiclaimFor(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens, address _account)` that leaves `mgpPerSec` unreconciled with `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(masterMagpie)`, violates the invariant that an approval helper on a hot path must be idempotent; a single stuck allowance must not be able to disable claiming for all users, and delivers High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `multiclaimFor(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens, address _account)` (mechanism: safeApprove non-zero-allowance revert in _sendVlMGPFor)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `multiclaimFor(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens, address _account)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _account (any victim), the staking-token list and the per-pool reward-token lists
- Exploit idea: _sendVlMGPFor() calls IERC20(mgp).safeApprove(address(vlmgp), _amount) without first zeroing the allowance, so any residue left by a partially-consuming lockFor permanently bricks every subsequent default-pool claim. Precondition: the contract is paused so only emergencyWithdraw is reachable.
- Invariant to test: an approval helper on a hot path must be idempotent; a single stuck allowance must not be able to disable claiming for all users; concretely, `mgpPerSec` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(masterMagpie)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the contract is paused so only emergencyWithdraw is reachable, snapshot `mgpPerSec` and `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(masterMagpie)`, run the attacker's `multiclaimFor(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens, address _account)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
