# Q937: BlockGasLimit - Unlimited Maxgas Returns Maxuint64 And Overflows Downstream Fee Math

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `block gas limit lookup for EVM execution and estimates` while controlling `fee cap` and `leftoverGas`, under the precondition that the transaction consumes near its gas limit but remains valid, drive `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas` in `types/block.go::BlockGasLimit` so that unlimited MaxGas returns MaxUint64 and overflows downstream fee math, violating the invariant that a valid tx must never receive a refund greater than escrowed fees, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `types/block.go::BlockGasLimit`
- Entrypoint: `block gas limit lookup for EVM execution and estimates`
- Attacker controls: `fee cap`, `leftoverGas`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: unlimited MaxGas returns MaxUint64 and overflows downstream fee math through `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas`.
- Invariant to test: a valid tx must never receive a refund greater than escrowed fees.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: add a fuzz case varying the attacker-controlled fields and differential-check against go-ethereum for tx validity, gas, nonce, and code/storage effects.
