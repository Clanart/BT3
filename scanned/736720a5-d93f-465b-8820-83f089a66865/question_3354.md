# Q3354: NEAR Wormhole DeployToken conversion canonical token identity collision via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Wormhole deploy-token proof flow` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/parsed_vaa.rs::TryInto<DeployTokenMessage>` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `canonical token identity collision` under Borsh-decodes a Wormhole payload into `DeployTokenMessage` and derives the emitter address from the token-address chain and VAA emitter bytes, violating `one remote token identity must map to one local deploy-token message with one canonical chain binding and decimal model`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/parsed_vaa.rs::TryInto<DeployTokenMessage>`
- Entrypoint: `public Wormhole deploy-token proof flow`
- Attacker controls: payload bytes inside a validated VAA, token id string, token address chain, decimals, and origin decimals
- Exploit idea: Target hashed token ids, deterministic synthetic addresses, PDA seeds, and address-to-token maps. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: one remote token identity must map to one local deploy-token message with one canonical chain binding and decimal model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Search for collisions and alias conditions and assert that two distinct remote assets cannot share one local token identity or mapping row. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
