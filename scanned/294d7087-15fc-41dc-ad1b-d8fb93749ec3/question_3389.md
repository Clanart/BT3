# Q3389: votes_len settles one authorization twice (vote_state_view.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `votes_len` in `vote/src/vote_state_view.rs` with an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure, and have `votes_len` apply the same authorized effect a second time, so that the invariant "One signed authorization produces exactly one state effect." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_state_view.rs` -> `votes_len()` (around line 137)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure
- Exploit idea: Get `votes_len` to apply the same logical effect twice from a single user authorization by re-entering it or replaying the surrounding flow.
- Invariant to test: One signed authorization produces exactly one state effect.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Integration test: submit the flow twice (and once re-entrantly) and assert the second application is rejected and balances moved once.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can escalate instruction privileges through CPI, account serialization, or signer-seed handling and mutate or drain an account the top-level transaction never authorized as writable or signed.
