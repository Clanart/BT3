# Q3010: notify_roots slot-removal liveness bug

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_roots` by subscribe to roots and then drive hot slot/root movement with root subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot root movement so that slot-removal logic can discard account data still needed by later state resolution, breaking the invariant that slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_roots
- Entrypoint: subscribe to roots and then drive hot slot/root movement
- Attacker controls: root subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot root movement
- Exploit idea: target old/new slot overlap for the same pubkey
- Invariant to test: slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn one pubkey across removable and non-removable slots
