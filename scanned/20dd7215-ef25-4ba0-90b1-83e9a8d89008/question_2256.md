# Q2256: process_transactions nonce replay window

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_transactions` by use json-rpc `sendtransaction` from one low-rate client with serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, duplicate-signature timing, and queue pressure such that durable nonce or recent-blockhash state can be observed one way here and a different way later in the same submission lifecycle, breaking the invariant that nonce and blockhash freshness checks must be stable across the full processing pipeline and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs::process_transactions
- Entrypoint: use JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from one low-rate client
- Attacker controls: serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, duplicate-signature timing, and queue pressure
- Exploit idea: find a same-slot or retry-driven way to reuse a nonce or stale blockhash window
- Invariant to test: nonce and blockhash freshness checks must be stable across the full processing pipeline
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: replay durable-nonce and edge-age blockhash transactions across retries and batches
