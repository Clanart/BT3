# Q3322: subset via collateral-remove: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `subset` tests bitmask containment, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
