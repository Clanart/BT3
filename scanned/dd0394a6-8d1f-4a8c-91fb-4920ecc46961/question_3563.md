# Q3563: NEAR remove_transfer_message flows replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public sign/finalize/claim callbacks through transfer cleanup` with control over transfer id, callback success/failure, storage owner, and removal order relative to payout or refund and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::remove_transfer_message/remove_fin_transfer/remove_transfer_message_without_refund` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly` attack class because cleans up pending-transfer state after signing, fee claim, callback refunds, or finalization failure, violating `cleanup must never reopen replay protection or double-refund storage while the economic effect of the transfer already escaped`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::remove_transfer_message/remove_fin_transfer/remove_transfer_message_without_refund`
- Entrypoint: `public sign/finalize/claim callbacks through transfer cleanup`
- Attacker controls: transfer id, callback success/failure, storage owner, and removal order relative to payout or refund
- Exploit idea: Stress replay-protection state keyed only by nonce, transfer id, or bitmap position across branches and chains. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: cleanup must never reopen replay protection or double-refund storage while the economic effect of the transfer already escaped
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Replay valid proofs/signatures with altered non-economic fields and assert that only the exact originally-settled event is rejected as already used. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::remove_transfer_message/remove_fin_transfer/remove_transfer_message_without_refund` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
