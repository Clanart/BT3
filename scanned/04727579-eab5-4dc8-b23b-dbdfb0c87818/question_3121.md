# Q3121: Misbind storage-proof semantics in collect_deposit_move_txids

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes so `collect_deposit_move_txids` treats one storage slot, value, or path as proving another, corrupting the light-client proof context tied to a specific Bitcoin block and violating the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/citrea.rs::collect_deposit_move_txids
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Exploit idea: treat one storage slot/value/path as if it proved another using light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
