# Q2268: vault-system-borrow via liquidate-multi: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) reach `vault-system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198` -> `vault-system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `vault-system-borrow` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
