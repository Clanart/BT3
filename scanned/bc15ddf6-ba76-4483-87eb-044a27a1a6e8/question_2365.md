# Q2365: accounts_db.load hot-stream starvation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by submit transactions or make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that force repeated account lookups with high-churn account creation/close patterns, repeated reads, and same-pubkey updates across nearby slots so that one hot account/program/signature stream monopolizes work and starves other subscribers, breaking the invariant that one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::load
- Entrypoint: submit transactions or make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that force repeated account lookups
- Attacker controls: high-churn account creation/close patterns, repeated reads, and same-pubkey updates across nearby slots
- Exploit idea: measure cross-subscriber fairness
- Invariant to test: one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: pair a hot stream with a cheap control subscription
