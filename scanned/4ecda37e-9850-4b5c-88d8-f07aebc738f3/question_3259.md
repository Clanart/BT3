# Q3259: receive: A `:type` value that maps to an unintended registered webhook h...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `:type` route segment, the raw body, and all webhook headers) reach `receive` in app/controllers/shopify_app/webhooks_controller.rb via POST /webhooks/:type, supplying a `:type` value that maps to an unintended registered webhook handler, so that no webhook side effect may run before HMAC verification succeeds over the raw body is violated, leading to forged webhook processing (unauthorized state change)? Specifically confirm that a wrong-secret or tampered artifact is always rejected before any side effect.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/webhooks_controller.rb — `receive`
- Entrypoint: POST /webhooks/:type
- Attacker controls: the `:type` route segment, the raw body, and all webhook headers — specifically a `:type` value that maps to an unintended registered webhook handler.
- Exploit idea: Run the exact flow with a deliberately-wrong secret/signature/token to prove verification actually rejects it.
- Invariant to test: no webhook side effect may run before HMAC verification succeeds over the raw body
- Expected Immunefi impact: forged webhook processing (unauthorized state change) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: negative-control test asserting a wrong-secret/wrong-signature/tampered-token request is rejected with no side effect.
