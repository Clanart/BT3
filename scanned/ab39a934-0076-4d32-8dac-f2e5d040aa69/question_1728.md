# Q1728: Confuse replacement linkage in select_confirmed_tx_info

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering so `select_confirmed_tx_info` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the L1/L2 height pair treated as finalized and safe to bridge against to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/sync.rs::select_confirmed_tx_info
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
