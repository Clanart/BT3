# Q2902: Allowance Window Drift By Reusing Data Cross Module

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BandwidthManager.purchase(...) -> pallet_ismp::handle_unsigned(origin=None, messages)` with attacker-controlled authenticated purchase messages, app and chain identifiers, tier configuration values, and replay ordering and reusing data that should belong to one chain, module, order, state machine, or payee in another publicly reachable path, and make `on_accept` make remaining allowance, subscription expiry, or renewal logic diverge from purchased credit so `the remaining allowance or subscription window` becomes inconsistent with `the precise purchased schedule and bytes entitlement`, breaking the invariant that remaining bandwidth and expiry windows must track purchased credit monotonically without duplicate application or skipped depletion and leading to High: permanent lock, burn, or loss of user funds or rewards in a production flow?

## Target
- File/function: modules/pallets/bandwidth/src/lib.rs::on_accept
- Entrypoint: BandwidthManager.purchase(...) -> pallet_ismp::handle_unsigned(origin=None, messages)
- Attacker controls: authenticated purchase messages, app and chain identifiers, tier configuration values, and replay ordering
- Exploit idea: Make remaining allowance, subscription expiry, or renewal logic diverge from purchased credit. Craft two public flows that share one byte string or hash and check whether module, chain, or payee binding is enforced everywhere.
- Invariant to test: remaining bandwidth and expiry windows must track purchased credit monotonically without duplicate application or skipped depletion
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: permanent lock, burn, or loss of user funds or rewards in a production flow.
- Fast validation: Purchase, consume, and renew across boundary conditions and assert no extra credit appears and no live credit disappears. Feed the same bytes through two reachable entrypoints and assert the second path rejects instead of inheriting the first path's authorization.
