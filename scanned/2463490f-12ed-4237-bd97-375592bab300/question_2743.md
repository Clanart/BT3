# Q2743: NEAR fast_fin_transfer dispatcher native versus wrapped branch switch via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through ``ft_on_transfer` branch for fast finalization` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fast_fin_transfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `native versus wrapped branch switch` under requires a trusted relayer, denormalizes amount and fee for the origin token, checks whether the referenced transfer is already finalised, and either pays a Near recipient immediately or emits a new transfer to another chain, violating `a fast path must never let relayers front-load value for an event that can later settle differently, twice, or with a different fee/recipient binding`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fast_fin_transfer`
- Entrypoint: ``ft_on_transfer` branch for fast finalization`
- Attacker controls: token id, amount, signer identity as relayer, transfer id, recipient, fee, message, and optional storage deposit amount
- Exploit idea: Target zero-address, deployed-token, custom-minter, native-vault, or bridge-token branch predicates. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: a fast path must never let relayers front-load value for an event that can later settle differently, twice, or with a different fee/recipient binding
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each branch predicate to flip around callbacks or mapping writes and assert that the same source asset can never produce two incompatible custody models. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
