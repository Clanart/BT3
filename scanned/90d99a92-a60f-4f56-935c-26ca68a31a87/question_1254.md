# Q1254: collect_balances balance prepost mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `collect_balances` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transactions that resize accounts, trigger cpi, and partially fail after touching many balances such that balance collection or reporting can disagree with the actual state transition that commits, breaking the invariant that reported balances must match committed balances and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::collect_balances
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transactions that resize accounts, trigger CPI, and partially fail after touching many balances
- Exploit idea: look for mismatches between reported and real lamport deltas
- Invariant to test: reported balances must match committed balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: compare pre/post balances returned by tracing against a direct account diff
