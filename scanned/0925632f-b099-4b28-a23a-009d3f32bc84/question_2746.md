# Q2746: load_latest zero-lamport resurrection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_latest` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads for hot accounts under continuous rewrites with same-pubkey rewrites across slots with immediate reads so that dead or zero-lamport accounts can survive or reappear because cleanup and load paths disagree, breaking the invariant that closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::load_latest
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads for hot accounts under continuous rewrites
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey rewrites across slots with immediate reads
- Exploit idea: look for stale dead-account visibility after close/recreate churn
- Invariant to test: closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: close and recreate the same attacker-controlled account shape repeatedly
