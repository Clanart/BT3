# Q2319: WombatPoolHelper.depositNative - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Starting from a state where the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, can an unprivileged EOA use `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` to leave `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` inconsistent with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`, violating the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard and extracting Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, snapshot `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` and `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`, run the attacker's `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
