# Q1048: commit_transactions late-failure leakage

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `commit_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transactions that partially fail, write many accounts, resize data, and alter fees or rent state such that transactions that fail very late after touching many accounts can leak partial side effects into caches, logs, or counters observed later, breaking the invariant that late failures must roll back every consensus-relevant state effect and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::commit_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transactions that partially fail, write many accounts, resize data, and alter fees or rent state
- Exploit idea: force the failure point as late as possible
- Invariant to test: late failures must roll back every consensus-relevant state effect
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: create deep CPI graphs that fail at the end and diff every derived cache/counter afterward
