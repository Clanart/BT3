# Q2962: mWOM.deposit - no whenNotPaused on the internal _convert guard ordering

## Question
In wombat/mWOM.sol, _convert carries whenNotPaused and nonReentrant while the external wrappers carry whenNotPaused too, so the pause state is evaluated twice around an external transfer and the WOM leg can land in a different pause state than the mint leg. Does `deposit(uint256 _amount)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the attacker calls convertAllWom on WombatStaking in the same transaction, so that `rewardRatio` diverges from `DENOMINATOR`, the invariant that the pause state governing a value transfer and the mint it backs must be evaluated once is broken, and the result is High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWOM.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount)` (mechanism: no whenNotPaused on the internal _convert guard ordering)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, which mints mWOM 1:1 while leaving the WOM sitting in this contract unlocked
- Exploit idea: _convert carries whenNotPaused and nonReentrant while the external wrappers carry whenNotPaused too, so the pause state is evaluated twice around an external transfer and the WOM leg can land in a different pause state than the mint leg. Precondition: the attacker calls convertAllWom on WombatStaking in the same transaction.
- Invariant to test: the pause state governing a value transfer and the mint it backs must be evaluated once; concretely, `rewardRatio` must stay reconciled with `DENOMINATOR`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the attacker calls convertAllWom on WombatStaking in the same transaction, snapshot `rewardRatio` and `DENOMINATOR`, run the attacker's `deposit(uint256 _amount)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
