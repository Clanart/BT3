# Q3890: shopify_id_token: An `id_token` URL param that overrides/undercuts the Authorizat...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the Authorization header, the `id_token` URL param, and the JWT body) reach `shopify_id_token / jwt_payload / jwt_shopify_domain` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/with_shopify_id_token.rb via any request to a controller including WithShopifyIdToken (auth, CSRF, ensure_authenticated_links), supplying an `id_token` URL param that overrides/undercuts the Authorization header when the header is absent, so that choosing header vs param must not let an attacker supply a second, weaker token is violated, leading to session confusion / auth bypass? Specifically confirm that the gem's canonical form matches Shopify's signed canonical form exactly.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/with_shopify_id_token.rb — `shopify_id_token / jwt_payload / jwt_shopify_domain`
- Entrypoint: any request to a controller including WithShopifyIdToken (auth, CSRF, ensure_authenticated_links)
- Attacker controls: the Authorization header, the `id_token` URL param, and the JWT body — specifically an `id_token` URL param that overrides/undercuts the Authorization header when the header is absent.
- Exploit idea: Probe whether the gem's canonical form of shop/host/params matches Shopify's exact canonicalization.
- Invariant to test: choosing header vs param must not let an attacker supply a second, weaker token
- Expected Immunefi impact: session confusion / auth bypass (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: canonicalization test comparing the gem's normalized string to Shopify's signed canonical form byte-for-byte.
