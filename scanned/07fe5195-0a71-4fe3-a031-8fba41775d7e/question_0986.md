# Q986: load_execute_and_commit_transactions writeback ordering

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_execute_and_commit_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with versioned messages, alt-heavy account sets, cpi depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets such that writes can land in a different order than the logic assumed when computing fees, locks, or state deltas, breaking the invariant that writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::load_execute_and_commit_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, ALT-heavy account sets, CPI depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: search for ordering dependencies that break under batching or CPI
- Invariant to test: writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace write order and derived counters under multi-instruction, multi-CPI transactions
