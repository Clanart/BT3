# Q2411: flush_accounts_cache notification filter overload

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `flush_accounts_cache` by submit transactions that touch many writable accounts and then query them immediately with many-account write bursts, slot churn, and immediate read-after-write rpcs so that attacker-chosen notification filters force more post-filter work than the subscriber semantics imply, breaking the invariant that notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::flush_accounts_cache
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that touch many writable accounts and then query them immediately
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts, slot churn, and immediate read-after-write RPCs
- Exploit idea: use valid subscription filters as the amplifier
- Invariant to test: notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: compare pre-filter candidate counts to delivered-notification counts
