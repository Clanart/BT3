# Q2094: get_connection_stake balance prepost mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `get_connection_stake` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one unstaked client with connection identifiers, certificate/pubkey choices, source-ip reuse, and connection churn timing such that balance collection or reporting can disagree with the actual state transition that commits, breaking the invariant that reported balances must match committed balances and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/nonblocking/quic.rs::get_connection_stake
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one unstaked client
- Attacker controls: connection identifiers, certificate/pubkey choices, source-IP reuse, and connection churn timing
- Exploit idea: look for mismatches between reported and real lamport deltas
- Invariant to test: reported balances must match committed balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: compare pre/post balances returned by tracing against a direct account diff
