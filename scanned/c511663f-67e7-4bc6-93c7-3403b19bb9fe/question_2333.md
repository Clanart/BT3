# Q2333: servicer sysvar snapshot drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `servicer` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one client with packet layouts, signature counts, versioned messages, and duplicate-account transaction shapes such that clock, rent, blockhash, or slot-hash values observed here can drift relative to the state later committed, breaking the invariant that a transaction should observe one coherent sysvar snapshot for its admitted execution context and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/sigverify_stage.rs::servicer
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one client
- Attacker controls: packet layouts, signature counts, versioned messages, and duplicate-account transaction shapes
- Exploit idea: search for split sysvar snapshots across one processing lifecycle
- Invariant to test: a transaction should observe one coherent sysvar snapshot for its admitted execution context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace sysvar values at admission, execution, and commit
