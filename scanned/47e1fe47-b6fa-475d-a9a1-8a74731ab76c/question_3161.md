# Q3161: Parse a malformed object path in list_unfinalized_cancel_txids

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft the `rbf_signing_info` object so `list_unfinalized_cancel_txids` parses, hashes, or stores one object while later logic signs, verifies, or settles a meaningfully different one, corrupting the finalized/seen-at-height status recorded for the send request and violating the invariant that queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/db/tx_sender.rs::list_unfinalized_cancel_txids
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `rbf_signing_info` object
- Exploit idea: parse, hash, or store one object while later logic settles another by crafting the `rbf_signing_info` object
- Invariant to test: queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
