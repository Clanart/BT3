# Q308: Accept wrong proof/network context in send_aggregate_txs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings through user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync so `send_aggregate_txs` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the linkage between Citrea state and a replacement deposit move transaction and breaking the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/sync.rs::send_aggregate_txs
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
