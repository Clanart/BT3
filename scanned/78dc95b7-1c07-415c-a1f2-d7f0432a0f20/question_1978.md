# Q1978: WombatBribeManager.harvestSinglePool - getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)` under the attacker locks vlMGP, votes and casts inside a single transaction and force `getVoteForLp(lp) from the Wombat voter` apart from `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp`, breaking the invariant that the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance for Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)` (mechanism: getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the lp array, forwarded straight into WombatStaking.vote with zero deltas and caller set to address(0)
- Exploit idea: getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Precondition: the attacker locks vlMGP, votes and casts inside a single transaction.
- Invariant to test: the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance; concretely, `getVoteForLp(lp) from the Wombat voter` must stay reconciled with `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (the lp array, forwarded straight into WombatStaking.vote with zero deltas and caller set to address(0)) under the attacker locks vlMGP, votes and casts inside a single transaction, asserting on every row that the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance.
