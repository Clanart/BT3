# Q5112: active via collateral-add: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) reach `active` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238` -> `active`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Reach it through `collateral-add` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `active` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
