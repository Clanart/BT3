# Q0748: write-feeds via collateral-remove: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch) reach `write-feeds` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:149` -> `write-feeds`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `write-feeds` folds up to three attacker-supplied buffers through `write-feed` with a `(response bool uint)` accumulator. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
