# Q0608: get-asset-value via collateral-remove: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `get-asset-value` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
