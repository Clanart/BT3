# Q2545: modify_accounts write-cache ordering drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `modify_accounts` by submit transactions that update many related accounts in one bank with many writable accounts, cpi-heavy writes, and same-pubkey alias churn so that writeback ordering can make later readers observe a different account version than accounting code assumed, breaking the invariant that write-cache ordering must preserve one coherent latest-account view and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::modify_accounts
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that update many related accounts in one bank
- Attacker controls: many writable accounts, CPI-heavy writes, and same-pubkey alias churn
- Exploit idea: search for ordering-sensitive reads around flush/writeback boundaries
- Invariant to test: write-cache ordering must preserve one coherent latest-account view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace storage writes and immediate reads during slot/root churn
