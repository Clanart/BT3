# Q2794: roots_to_flush stale cache replay

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `roots_to_flush` by submit transactions that keep many roots dirty while reading hot accounts with heavy write churn across nearby roots plus immediate reads so that stale cached account content can outlive the storage or bank state that later logic expects, breaking the invariant that caches must not serve account data from an impossible slot/state combination and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::roots_to_flush
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that keep many roots dirty while reading hot accounts
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn across nearby roots plus immediate reads
- Exploit idea: read an impossible old value after the canonical state has changed
- Invariant to test: caches must not serve account data from an impossible slot/state combination
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race rewrites and immediate reads, then diff cache-derived results against storage and bank views
