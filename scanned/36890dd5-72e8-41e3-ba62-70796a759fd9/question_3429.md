# Q3429: WombatPoolHelper.depositLP - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Does `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, so that `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` diverges from `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding is broken, and the result is High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, then assert `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` end identical in both runs.
