# Q224: NEAR OmniToken mint asset-branch confusion on finalization via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public bridge-token mint path via controller-only callback reached from bridge delivery` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-token/src/lib.rs::mint` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `asset-branch confusion on finalization` under controller-only mint either deposits directly or first credits the predecessor account then calls `ft_transfer_call` to the recipient when `msg` is present, violating `mint-with-message and plain mint must be economically equivalent and must not create balances on the controller or recipient that survive inconsistent callback outcomes`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-token/src/lib.rs::mint`
- Entrypoint: `public bridge-token mint path via controller-only callback reached from bridge delivery`
- Attacker controls: recipient account, amount, optional `msg`, and any receiver behavior in `ft_transfer_call`
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: mint-with-message and plain mint must be economically equivalent and must not create balances on the controller or recipient that survive inconsistent callback outcomes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
