# Q5003: WombatPoolHelper.withdraw - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. With _liquidity and _minAmount, with the payout measured as a balance delta under attacker control and an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, can an unprivileged caller sequence `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` so that `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` and `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value and realising Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity and _minAmount, with the payout measured as a balance delta
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`: constrain the setup so that an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, fuzz the attacker inputs (_liquidity and _minAmount, with the payout measured as a balance delta), and assert after every call that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value.
