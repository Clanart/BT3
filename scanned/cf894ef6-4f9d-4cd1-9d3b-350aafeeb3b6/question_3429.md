# Q3429: Break reimbursement recoverability in create_emergency_stop_txhandler

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with crafted the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context so `create_emergency_stop_txhandler` moves the protocol past the point where reimbursement should remain recoverable, leaving the verifier nonce session that a final signature is supposed to consume inconsistent with the assumption that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, and leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/builder/transaction/mod.rs::create_emergency_stop_txhandler
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context
- Exploit idea: move bridge state forward while reimbursement/slashability stays tied to older state
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
