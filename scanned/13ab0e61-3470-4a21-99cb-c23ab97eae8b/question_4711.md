# Q4711: vault-system-borrow via borrow: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`vault-system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198) routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the future mask produced by the new debt bit, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198` -> `vault-system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `borrow` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, then read `vault-system-borrow` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
