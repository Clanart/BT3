# Q5017: ubalance via liquidate-redeem: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `ubalance` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303) — which reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303` -> `ubalance`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, then read `ubalance` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
