# Q3733: lookup via collateral-add: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, drive `lookup` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139) — which returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration — to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:139` -> `lookup`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `lookup` returns the registry record, including the `decimals` captured once at registration. Reach it through `collateral-add` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with the position's existing collateral and debt composition, then read `lookup` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
