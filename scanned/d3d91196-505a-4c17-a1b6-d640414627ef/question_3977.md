# Q3977: from clvm allow replay across contexts via CLVM atoms with redundant sign bytes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker serialize typed values back into CLVM targeting `from_clvm` in `crates/clvm-utils/src/curried_program.rs` with CLVM atoms with redundant sign bytes when duplicate or prefix-colliding items are present make chia_rs allow replay across contexts, violating the invariant that FromClvm and ToClvm round trips preserve semantics, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-utils/src/curried_program.rs:17` / `from_clvm`
- Entrypoint: serialize typed values back into CLVM
- Attacker controls: CLVM atoms with redundant sign bytes
- Exploit idea: Drive `from_clvm` through its public caller path using CLVM atoms with redundant sign bytes; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: FromClvm and ToClvm round trips preserve semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data
- Fast validation: round-trip ToClvm/FromClvm and compare tree hashes.
