# Q4405: accrue-collateral-asset via liquidate: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, drive `accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) — which maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, then read `accrue-collateral-asset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
