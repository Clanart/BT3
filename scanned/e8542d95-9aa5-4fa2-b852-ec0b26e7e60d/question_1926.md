# Q1926: get-egroup via liquidate-multi: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `get-egroup` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
