# Q2587: send-tokens via collateral-remove-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), then read `send-tokens` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
