# Q4950: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.depositNative - receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Under the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, is there an unprivileged sequence of `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` that leaves `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` unreconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`, violates the invariant that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Precondition: the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling.
- Invariant to test: the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, call `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, and assert `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` equals `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
