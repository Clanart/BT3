# Q236: Accept wrong proof/network context in verify_tar_image_digest

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context through broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation so `verify_tar_image_digest` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove context treated as canonical for a deposit and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/docker.rs::verify_tar_image_digest
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
