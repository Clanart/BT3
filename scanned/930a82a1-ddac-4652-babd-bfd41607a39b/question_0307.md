# Q307: NEAR storage account-id calculation origin and destination nonce desynchronization via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public outbound transfers that allow `external_id`` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::calculate_storage_account_id and init-transfer callers` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `origin and destination nonce desynchronization` under derives a per-transfer storage account id that can be pre-funded and later used to resume deferred transfers, violating `storage account ids must be collision-resistant across attacker-controlled `external_id` choices so one user cannot fund or resume another user’s transfer`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::calculate_storage_account_id and init-transfer callers`
- Entrypoint: `public outbound transfers that allow `external_id``
- Attacker controls: `external_id`, sender, recipient, token, origin nonce, and any fields used to derive the message-storage account id
- Exploit idea: Drive retries, resume paths, or recursive bridge legs until one deposit appears under more than one transfer identity. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: storage account ids must be collision-resistant across attacker-controlled `external_id` choices so one user cannot fund or resume another user’s transfer
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trace every nonce mutation site and fuzz repeated calls plus reordered callbacks to prove that one deposit cannot create two valid transfer ids or destination messages. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
