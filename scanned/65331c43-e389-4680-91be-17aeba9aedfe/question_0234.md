# Q234: EVM OmniBridge initTransfer origin and destination nonce desynchronization via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public EVM outbound transfer entrypoint` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::initTransfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `origin and destination nonce desynchronization` under increments `currentOriginNonce`, enforces `fee < amount`, collects or burns assets depending on native/custom/bridge-token branches, and forwards value to `initTransferExtension`, violating `one outbound transfer must consume exactly the assets represented by the emitted bridge event and must not let branch-specific accounting diverge from the signed or relayed payload`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::initTransfer`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM outbound transfer entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: token address, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, message bytes, and msg.value
- Exploit idea: Drive retries, resume paths, or recursive bridge legs until one deposit appears under more than one transfer identity. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: one outbound transfer must consume exactly the assets represented by the emitted bridge event and must not let branch-specific accounting diverge from the signed or relayed payload
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trace every nonce mutation site and fuzz repeated calls plus reordered callbacks to prove that one deposit cannot create two valid transfer ids or destination messages. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
