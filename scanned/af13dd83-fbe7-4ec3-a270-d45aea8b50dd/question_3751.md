# Q3751: Break reimbursement recoverability in blockhashdb_encode_decode_invariant

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with crafted the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context so `blockhashdb_encode_decode_invariant` moves the protocol past the point where reimbursement should remain recoverable, leaving the deposit-to-move-tx binding inconsistent with the assumption that partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind, and leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/wrapper.rs::blockhashdb_encode_decode_invariant
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context
- Exploit idea: move bridge state forward while reimbursement/slashability stays tied to older state
- Invariant to test: partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
