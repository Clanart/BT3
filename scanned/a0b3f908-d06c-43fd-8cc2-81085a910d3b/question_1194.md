# Q1194: Exploit ordering assumptions in assert_single_op_return_commitment_outputs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use attacker-controlled reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height so `assert_single_op_return_commitment_outputs` validates the right inputs in the wrong order, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/bridge_circuit_host.rs::assert_single_op_return_commitment_outputs
- Entrypoint: broadcast a crafted Bitcoin kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transaction that later reaches sync and verifier logic
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: validate the right pieces in the wrong order using reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
