# Q2867: notify_subscribers queue-drain mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_subscribers` by trigger in-scope subscriptions and then submit transactions that generate hot notifications with subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot-account / hot-program event streams so that the queue behind this function drains more slowly than one valid subscription shape can fill it even at realistic rates, breaking the invariant that one valid subscription must not create a persistently negative drain ratio and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_subscribers
- Entrypoint: trigger in-scope subscriptions and then submit transactions that generate hot notifications
- Attacker controls: subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot-account / hot-program event streams
- Exploit idea: treat steady-state drain ratio as the invariant
- Invariant to test: one valid subscription must not create a persistently negative drain ratio
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: measure fill/drain ratio for the hottest legal notification source
