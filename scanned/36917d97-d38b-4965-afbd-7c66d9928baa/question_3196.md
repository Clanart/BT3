# Q3196: execute_entry_point attacker-driven shutdown path in execution/execute_entry_point.cairo (boundary-value edge)

## Question
Can a malicious Cairo contract reached from a valid user transaction, using attacker-chosen syscall inputs use selector, calldata length, nested call structure, gas/resource edge cases to make `execute_entry_point` in `crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/execute_entry_point.cairo` use valid attacker-controlled input to drive this path into deterministic aborts or unresolvable disagreement that stop honest nodes from confirming new transactions around builtin-pointer soundness, so that honest StarkNet OS execution commits, emits, or accepts an attacker-favorable result that reaches total network shutdown? Specifically, can boundary field values, empty/non-empty transitions, or zero-special-case branches trigger the discrepancy?

## Target
- File/function: crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/execute_entry_point.cairo:142 :: execute_entry_point
- Entrypoint: malicious Cairo contract reached from a valid user transaction, using attacker-chosen syscall inputs
- Attacker controls: selector, calldata length, nested call structure, gas/resource edge cases
- Exploit idea: find an input shape that turns a local assertion, ordering assumption, or hinted value dependency into a protocol-wide confirmation failure while this function is handling builtin-pointer soundness. Use attacker-chosen boundary values, zero sentinels, and empty/non-empty transitions to hit the sharp branch in this path.
- Invariant to test: public StarkNet OS inputs must not give an unprivileged attacker a deterministic way to halt confirmation or crash honest execution for otherwise valid blocks Boundary values and zero-special-case handling must preserve the same security and accounting invariant as ordinary values.
- Expected bounty impact: Total network shutdown
- Fast validation: fuzz adversarial but valid public inputs that maximize this function's structural edge cases, then assert honest nodes either all reject before block inclusion or all keep confirming transactions Add a focused fuzz harness around zero, max-sized, empty, and single-element cases and assert the same invariant still holds.
