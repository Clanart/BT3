# Q3922: check_shop_domain: The legacy `validate_non_embedded_session` REST `get('shop')` p...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `shop` param and `host`/`embedded` params) reach `check_shop_domain / current_shopify_domain / installed_shop_session` in app/controllers/concerns/shopify_app/ensure_installed.rb via GET any EnsureInstalled controller action, supplying the legacy `validate_non_embedded_session` REST `get('shop')` performed with `installed_shop_session` of an attacker-chosen shop, so that the loaded installed shop session must correspond to the merchant proven to control the shop, not a raw param is violated, leading to cross-shop access: loading/acting with another store's offline session? Specifically confirm that the crafted request is rejected or scoped to the attacker's own shop.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/concerns/shopify_app/ensure_installed.rb — `check_shop_domain / current_shopify_domain / installed_shop_session`
- Entrypoint: GET any EnsureInstalled controller action
- Attacker controls: the `shop` param and `host`/`embedded` params — specifically the legacy `validate_non_embedded_session` REST `get('shop')` performed with `installed_shop_session` of an attacker-chosen shop.
- Exploit idea: Craft the single HTTP request above against a default app install and confirm the boundary holds.
- Invariant to test: the loaded installed shop session must correspond to the merchant proven to control the shop, not a raw param
- Expected Immunefi impact: cross-shop access: loading/acting with another store's offline session (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: controller/request spec issuing the crafted request and asserting a 401/redirect-to-own-origin, not access.
