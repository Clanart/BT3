# Q2937: next-liquidity-index via repay: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) — which rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `repay` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `next-liquidity-index` touches, run `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
