# Q1181: create via collateral-remove-redeem: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `min-underlying`, drive `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) — which binds a principal to a fresh numeric id — to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-underlying`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
