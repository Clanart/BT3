# Q4575: total-supply-preview via redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-supply-preview` touches, run `redeem` with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
