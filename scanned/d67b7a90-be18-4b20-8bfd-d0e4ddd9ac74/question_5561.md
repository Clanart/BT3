# Q5561: MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec - unregistered staking token smuggled into _multiClaim

## Question
rewards/MasterMagpie.sol: _multiClaim() reads tokenToPoolInfo[_stakingToken] for arbitrary caller-supplied addresses with no registeredToken membership check, so a never-added address yields a zero PoolInfo whose rewarder and accMGPPerShare are zero while the classification branches (vlmgp / MPGRewardPool / default) still execute. Under the contract has just been unpaused and lastRewardTimestamp is far behind block.timestamp, is there an unprivileged sequence of `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)` that leaves `unClaimedMgp[_stakingToken][user]` unreconciled with `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].rewardDebt`, violates the invariant that only pools actually added through add() may be routed through the claim classification and send branches, and delivers High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: unregistered staking token smuggled into _multiClaim)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: both outer and inner arrays, so every reward-token address and its order
- Exploit idea: _multiClaim() reads tokenToPoolInfo[_stakingToken] for arbitrary caller-supplied addresses with no registeredToken membership check, so a never-added address yields a zero PoolInfo whose rewarder and accMGPPerShare are zero while the classification branches (vlmgp / MPGRewardPool / default) still execute. Precondition: the contract has just been unpaused and lastRewardTimestamp is far behind block.timestamp.
- Invariant to test: only pools actually added through add() may be routed through the claim classification and send branches; concretely, `unClaimedMgp[_stakingToken][user]` must stay reconciled with `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].rewardDebt`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the contract has just been unpaused and lastRewardTimestamp is far behind block.timestamp, call `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)`, and assert `unClaimedMgp[_stakingToken][user]` equals `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].rewardDebt` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
