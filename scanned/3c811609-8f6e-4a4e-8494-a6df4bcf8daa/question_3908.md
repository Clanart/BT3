# Q3908: mask-to-list-collateral via collateral-remove: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64, the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers varied, and assert that the value `mask-to-list-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
