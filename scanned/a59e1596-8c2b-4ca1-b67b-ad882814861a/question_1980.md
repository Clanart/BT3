# Q1980: get-position via collateral-remove: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `get-position` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
