# Q3225: WombatPoolHelper.harvest - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `harvest()` while the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, and drive `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` out of agreement with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` - breaking the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value - for Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the exact block at which the pool's rewards are harvested and fee-split
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, have the attacker run `harvest()`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` versus `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
