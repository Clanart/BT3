# Q5791: WombatBribeManager.vote - getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown

## Question
wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol: getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Under the victim has a large unsettled balance in the pool rewarder, is there an unprivileged sequence of `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` that leaves `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` unreconciled with `totalVlMgpInVote`, violates the invariant that the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance, and delivers Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` (mechanism: getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries
- Exploit idea: getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Precondition: the victim has a large unsettled balance in the pool rewarder.
- Invariant to test: the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance; concretely, `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` must stay reconciled with `totalVlMgpInVote`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries) under the victim has a large unsettled balance in the pool rewarder, asserting on every row that the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance.
