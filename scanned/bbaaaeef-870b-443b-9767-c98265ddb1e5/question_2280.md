# Q2280: get-notional-evaluation via collateral-remove: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `get-notional-evaluation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514` -> `get-notional-evaluation`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `get-notional-evaluation` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
