# Q2598: resolve-ststx via collateral-remove-redeem: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-ststx` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:339` -> `resolve-ststx`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ststx` calls the external stSTX ratio contract inside price resolution and scales by STSTX-RATIO-DECIMALS with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `resolve-ststx` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
