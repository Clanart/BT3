# Q870: from clvm reuse stale verification state via big integer encodings

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker serialize typed values back into CLVM targeting `from_clvm` in `crates/clvm-traits/src/from_clvm.rs` with big integer encodings when equivalent-looking encodings are mixed make chia_rs reuse stale verification state, violating the invariant that list terminators cannot change parsed conditions, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-traits/src/from_clvm.rs:109` / `from_clvm`
- Entrypoint: serialize typed values back into CLVM
- Attacker controls: big integer encodings
- Exploit idea: Drive `from_clvm` through its public caller path using big integer encodings; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: list terminators cannot change parsed conditions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption
- Fast validation: round-trip ToClvm/FromClvm and compare tree hashes.
