# Q1642: increment via repay: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `increment` advances the user-id nonce, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `repay` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
