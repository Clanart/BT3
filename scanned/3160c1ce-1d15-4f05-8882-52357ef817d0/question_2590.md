# Q2590: Duplicate queue or processing state in verify_watchtower_challenges

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `verify_watchtower_challenges` twice with attacker-controlled the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the storage-proof key/value binding used for deposit or withdrawal validation and violating the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/mod.rs::verify_watchtower_challenges
- Entrypoint: broadcast a crafted Bitcoin kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transaction that later reaches sync and verifier logic
- Attacker controls: the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
