# Q2949: EVM Wormhole logMetadataExtension shared Wormhole nonce can be replayed or gap-filled through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public metadata flow through `logMetadata` on Wormhole-backed chains` with control over msg.value, current `wormholeNonce`, token address, name, symbol, and decimals and desynchronize `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::logMetadataExtension` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `shared Wormhole nonce can be replayed or gap-filled` attack class because serializes a Wormhole `LogMetadata` payload and publishes it before incrementing the nonce, violating `metadata publication must not let malicious tokens or publication edge cases create replayable or ambiguous remote deployment claims`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::logMetadataExtension`
- Entrypoint: `public metadata flow through `logMetadata` on Wormhole-backed chains`
- Attacker controls: msg.value, current `wormholeNonce`, token address, name, symbol, and decimals
- Exploit idea: Target contracts that reuse one monotonic Wormhole nonce across deploy, init, metadata, and finalize messages. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: metadata publication must not let malicious tokens or publication edge cases create replayable or ambiguous remote deployment claims
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Interleave message classes and failures and assert that nonce progression remains globally unique and monotonic for emitted messages. Also assert cross-module consistency between `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::logMetadataExtension` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
