# Q1960: NEAR remove_transfer_message flows storage payer or owner spoofing at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public sign/finalize/claim callbacks through transfer cleanup` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::remove_transfer_message/remove_fin_transfer/remove_transfer_message_without_refund` violate `cleanup must never reopen replay protection or double-refund storage while the economic effect of the transfer already escaped` in the `storage payer or owner spoofing` attack class because cleans up pending-transfer state after signing, fee claim, callback refunds, or finalization failure becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::remove_transfer_message/remove_fin_transfer/remove_transfer_message_without_refund`
- Entrypoint: `public sign/finalize/claim callbacks through transfer cleanup`
- Attacker controls: transfer id, callback success/failure, storage owner, and removal order relative to payout or refund
- Exploit idea: Exploit signer/predecessor splits, message-storage account ids, or promise bookkeeping to shift storage liabilities between accounts. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: cleanup must never reopen replay protection or double-refund storage while the economic effect of the transfer already escaped
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Simulate conflicting `sender_id`, `signer_id`, and pre-funded storage accounts and assert that only the intended payer can fund, resume, or recover that transfer. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
