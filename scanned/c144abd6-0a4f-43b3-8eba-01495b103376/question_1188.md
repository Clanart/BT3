# Q1188: request_payment: A `return_url = ...?shop=#{shop}&host=#{host}` built from `sess...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`shop`/`host` params that flow into the billing return_url and confirmation redirect) reach `request_payment / check_billing redirect` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/ensure_billing.rb via GET a billing-gated action without active payment, supplying a `return_url = ...?shop=#{shop}&host=#{host}` built from `session.shop` where shop is attacker-influenced, so that billing redirect/return URLs must be bound to the app + verified shop origin is violated, leading to open redirect via billing confirmation flow? Specifically confirm that the malicious input stays rejected across refactors (pinned fixture).

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/ensure_billing.rb — `request_payment / check_billing redirect`
- Entrypoint: GET a billing-gated action without active payment
- Attacker controls: `shop`/`host` params that flow into the billing return_url and confirmation redirect — specifically a `return_url = ...?shop=#{shop}&host=#{host}` built from `session.shop` where shop is attacker-influenced.
- Exploit idea: Encode the exact malicious input as a fixture so a future refactor can't silently reopen the hole.
- Invariant to test: billing redirect/return URLs must be bound to the app + verified shop origin
- Expected Immunefi impact: open redirect via billing confirmation flow (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: regression fixture pinning the malicious input to a rejected outcome for CI.
