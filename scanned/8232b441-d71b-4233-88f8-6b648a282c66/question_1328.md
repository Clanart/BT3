# Q1328: WombatPoolHelper.depositLP - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` while the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, and drive `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` out of agreement with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` - breaking the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding - for High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller) under the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, asserting on every row that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding.
