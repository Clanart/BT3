# Q4239: WombatPoolHelper.harvest - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, where WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Assuming the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `pid cached at construction` and `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` via `harvest()`, breaking the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding and producing High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the exact block at which the pool's rewards are harvested and fee-split
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `harvest()`: constrain the setup so that the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, fuzz the attacker inputs (the exact block at which the pool's rewards are harvested and fee-split), and assert after every call that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding.
