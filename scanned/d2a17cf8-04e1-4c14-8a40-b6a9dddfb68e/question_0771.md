# Q771: prepare_entry_batch ALT account explosion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `prepare_entry_batch` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transaction ordering, duplicated accounts, address lookup tables, and batched conflicting write sets such that address lookup tables make this function handle a much larger effective account surface than the early admission logic prices, breaking the invariant that versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::prepare_entry_batch
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transaction ordering, duplicated accounts, address lookup tables, and batched conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: use legal ALT expansion to amplify load, lock, or verification work
- Invariant to test: versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: benchmark identical logic with and without ALT expansion
