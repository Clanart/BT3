# Q1834: Keeper.DeductTxCostsFromUserBalance - Multi Message Tx Deducts Costs Before Later Message Invalidates Batch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `ante deduction of full Ethereum tx cost from sender` while controlling `gas limit` and `leftoverGas`, under the precondition that London and Prague rules are active on the target height, drive `VerifyFee -> DeductTxCostsFromUserBalance -> ApplyMessageWithConfig -> RefundGasWithPrice` in `x/evm/keeper/utils.go::Keeper.DeductTxCostsFromUserBalance` so that multi-message tx deducts costs before later message invalidates batch, violating the invariant that a valid tx must never receive a refund greater than escrowed fees, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/utils.go::Keeper.DeductTxCostsFromUserBalance`
- Entrypoint: `ante deduction of full Ethereum tx cost from sender`
- Attacker controls: `gas limit`, `leftoverGas`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: multi-message tx deducts costs before later message invalidates batch through `VerifyFee -> DeductTxCostsFromUserBalance -> ApplyMessageWithConfig -> RefundGasWithPrice`.
- Invariant to test: a valid tx must never receive a refund greater than escrowed fees.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: force the edge value at uint64/uint256/sdk.Int boundaries and assert no smaller debit, larger refund, or supply change occurs.
