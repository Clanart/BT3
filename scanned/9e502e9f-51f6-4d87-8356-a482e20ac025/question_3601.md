# Q3601: output_message_to_l1_hashes config-hash skew in os_utils__virtual.cairo (batch-ordering edge)

## Question
Can a malicious L1-to-L2 message sender controlling the message payload and timing use message payloads, message ordering, message-triggered calldata, declared class contents, entry-point tables, compiled class facts to make `output_message_to_l1_hashes` in `crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/os_utils__virtual.cairo` let attacker-visible output or proof state bind to one StarkNet OS config while execution or downstream verification uses another around L1/L2 message uniqueness and accounting, so that honest StarkNet OS execution commits, emits, or accepts an attacker-favorable result that reaches unintended chain split / network partition? Can the issue appear only when the attacker repeats or reorders otherwise valid actions inside the same block or state diff?

## Target
- File/function: crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/os_utils__virtual.cairo:15 :: output_message_to_l1_hashes
- Entrypoint: malicious L1-to-L2 message sender controlling the message payload and timing
- Attacker controls: message payloads, message ordering, message-triggered calldata, declared class contents, entry-point tables, compiled class facts
- Exploit idea: break the link between the config hash in global context, proof headers, fee token address, and serialized OS output while this function is handling L1/L2 message uniqueness and accounting. Exploit repeated valid actions, cross-transaction ordering, or same-block batching to surface the mismatch.
- Invariant to test: one accepted execution must have exactly one active OS configuration binding across execution, proof validation, and public output Reordering or repeating otherwise valid public actions within one block must not change the safety invariant beyond the intended deterministic state transition.
- Expected bounty impact: Unintended chain split / network partition
- Fast validation: vary chain_id, fee token address, public key hash, and proof headers around this function, then assert no accepted trace can mix config values across phases Write a same-block differential test that permutes the attacker-controlled actions and assert there is no extra accepted state, message, or accounting outcome.
