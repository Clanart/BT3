# Q5352: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.deposit - safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie

## Question
In wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Does `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, so that `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` diverges from `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`, the invariant that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent is broken, and the result is High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, have the attacker run `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` versus `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
