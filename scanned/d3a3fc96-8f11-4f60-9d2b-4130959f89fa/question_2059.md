# Q2059: handle_chunks capitalization drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `handle_chunks` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one client with quic chunk boundaries, packet counts, certificate/pubkey choices, and transaction payload sizes such that lamport deltas can leave capitalization counters inconsistent with the actual account set, breaking the invariant that global capitalization must equal the sum of committed account balances and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/nonblocking/quic.rs::handle_chunks
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one client
- Attacker controls: QUIC chunk boundaries, packet counts, certificate/pubkey choices, and transaction payload sizes
- Exploit idea: make failed or partial writes skew aggregate lamport accounting
- Invariant to test: global capitalization must equal the sum of committed account balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: compare capitalization counters to reconstructed account sums after late-failing multi-write transactions
