# Q2223: receive_txn_thread slow-path crash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `receive_txn_thread` by use json-rpc `sendtransaction` from one low-rate client with serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and duplicate-signature timing such that validly encoded attacker transactions can still reach an assertion, panic, or fatal allocation path through this function, breaking the invariant that user transactions must not be able to crash the validator through this path and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs::receive_txn_thread
- Entrypoint: use JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from one low-rate client
- Attacker controls: serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and duplicate-signature timing
- Exploit idea: treat the function as a crash surface as well as a logic surface
- Invariant to test: user transactions must not be able to crash the validator through this path
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: fuzz only valid transaction shapes that reach this function and stop on crashes
