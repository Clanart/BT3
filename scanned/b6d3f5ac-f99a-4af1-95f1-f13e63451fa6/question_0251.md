# Q251: Solana deploy_token canonical token identity collision via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Solana `deploy_token` instruction` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::deploy_token` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `canonical token identity collision` under verifies a NEAR-derived signature, creates a mint PDA from a hashed token string, writes metadata, and posts the new mint registration back to Near, violating `one signed remote asset identity must map to one mint PDA and one metadata record with no collision or decimal mismatch`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::deploy_token`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `deploy_token` instruction`
- Attacker controls: signed payload bytes, token string, name, symbol, decimals, payer funding, and derived PDA seeds
- Exploit idea: Target hashed token ids, deterministic synthetic addresses, PDA seeds, and address-to-token maps. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: one signed remote asset identity must map to one mint PDA and one metadata record with no collision or decimal mismatch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Search for collisions and alias conditions and assert that two distinct remote assets cannot share one local token identity or mapping row. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
