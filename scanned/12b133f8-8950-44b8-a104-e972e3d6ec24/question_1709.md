# Q1709: sort_shrink_indexes_by_bytes_saved can be driven into unbounded work (ancient_append_vecs.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `sort_shrink_indexes_by_bytes_saved` in `accounts-db/src/ancient_append_vecs.rs` with an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation, and make `sort_shrink_indexes_by_bytes_saved` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `sort_shrink_indexes_by_bytes_saved` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/ancient_append_vecs.rs` -> `sort_shrink_indexes_by_bytes_saved()` (around line 163)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `sort_shrink_indexes_by_bytes_saved` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `sort_shrink_indexes_by_bytes_saved` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `sort_shrink_indexes_by_bytes_saved` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft bytecode, ELF metadata, precompile data, or zk proof input that panics, aborts, infinite-loops, or exhausts memory inside the VM and halts every validator.
