# Q313: Accept wrong proof/network context in calculate_feerate_sat_per_kvb

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering through user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync so `calculate_feerate_sat_per_kvb` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the storage slot/value pair used to prove deposit or withdrawal state and breaking the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/tests.rs::calculate_feerate_sat_per_kvb
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
