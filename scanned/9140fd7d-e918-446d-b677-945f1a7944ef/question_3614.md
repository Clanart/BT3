# Q3614: NEAR required_balance_for_init_transfer_message storage quote underestimates live state at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `internal accounting helper reached from public init-transfer paths` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::required_balance_for_init_transfer_message` violate `storage quoting must upper-bound every live outbound state footprint so attackers cannot create undercollateralized pending transfers` in the `storage quote underestimates live state` attack class because computes how much storage balance an outbound transfer needs before it can be stored or resumed becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::required_balance_for_init_transfer_message`
- Entrypoint: `internal accounting helper reached from public init-transfer paths`
- Attacker controls: recipient chain, message size, fee structure, origin transfer id usage, and calculated storage account id
- Exploit idea: Target helper functions that quote storage for pending transfers, finalization records, fast transfers, binds, or deployments. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: storage quoting must upper-bound every live outbound state footprint so attackers cannot create undercollateralized pending transfers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Measure storage usage across maximal inputs and assert that quoted requirements always exceed or equal the true post-state footprint. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
