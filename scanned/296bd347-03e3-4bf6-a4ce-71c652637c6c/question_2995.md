# Q2995: calc-liquidation-params via liquidate-multi: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
`calc-liquidation-params` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739) chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), use that to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739` -> `calc-liquidation-params`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), then read `calc-liquidation-params` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
