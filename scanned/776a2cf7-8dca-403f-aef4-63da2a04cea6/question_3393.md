# Q3393: vault-accrue via repay: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, drive `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) — which dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id — to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `repay` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `vault-accrue` touches, run `repay` with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
