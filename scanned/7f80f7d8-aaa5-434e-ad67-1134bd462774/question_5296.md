# Q5296: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.withdraw - the lockedAmount restriction is enforced only inside this helper

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol: withdraw() checks unlockTime and lockedAmount[msg.sender] against this.balance(msg.sender) after unstaking, but the underlying position is ordinary MasterMagpie stake in the same stakingToken, so the restriction is only as strong as this one code path. Under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, is there an unprivileged sequence of `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` that leaves `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` unreconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, violates the invariant that a time restriction on a position must be enforced where the position lives, not in one optional front-end contract, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: the lockedAmount restriction is enforced only inside this helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check
- Exploit idea: withdraw() checks unlockTime and lockedAmount[msg.sender] against this.balance(msg.sender) after unstaking, but the underlying position is ordinary MasterMagpie stake in the same stakingToken, so the restriction is only as strong as this one code path. Precondition: the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction.
- Invariant to test: a time restriction on a position must be enforced where the position lives, not in one optional front-end contract; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` sequence atomically under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, asserting at the end that `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` still equals `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
