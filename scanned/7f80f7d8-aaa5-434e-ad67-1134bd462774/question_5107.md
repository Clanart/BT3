# Q5107: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.harvest - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. With the harvest timing for the whole pool under attacker control and the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, can an unprivileged caller sequence `harvest()` so that `pid cached at construction` and `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard and realising Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the harvest timing for the whole pool
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, call `harvest()`, and assert `pid cached at construction` equals `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
