# Q2173: new: A `shop` with a dot so `sanitized_shop_name.split('.').first` y...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`shop`, `return_to`, `host`, `top_level`, `embedded`, and the Referer header) reach `new / create / authenticate / start_install / start_oauth` in app/controllers/shopify_app/sessions_controller.rb via GET/POST /login (public, unauthenticated), supplying a `shop` with a dot so `sanitized_shop_name.split('.').first` yields an attacker-chosen store handle in `unified_admin_path`, so that the install/OAuth target store must be the sanitized, attacker-independent shop, and return_to same-origin is violated, leading to OAuth flow initiated against an attacker-chosen store / open redirect on login? Specifically confirm that a replayed valid artifact yields no new session, token, or side effect.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/sessions_controller.rb — `new / create / authenticate / start_install / start_oauth`
- Entrypoint: GET/POST /login (public, unauthenticated)
- Attacker controls: `shop`, `return_to`, `host`, `top_level`, `embedded`, and the Referer header — specifically a `shop` with a dot so `sanitized_shop_name.split('.').first` yields an attacker-chosen store handle in `unified_admin_path`.
- Exploit idea: Replay a previously-valid artifact (token, HMAC body, OAuth code, callback) and confirm it is not re-accepted.
- Invariant to test: the install/OAuth target store must be the sanitized, attacker-independent shop, and return_to same-origin
- Expected Immunefi impact: OAuth flow initiated against an attacker-chosen store / open redirect on login (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: replay test capturing one valid flow and re-submitting it, asserting no second session/token/side-effect.
