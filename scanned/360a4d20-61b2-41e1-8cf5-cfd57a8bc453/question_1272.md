# Q1272: check-confidence via borrow: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `borrow` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `check-confidence` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
