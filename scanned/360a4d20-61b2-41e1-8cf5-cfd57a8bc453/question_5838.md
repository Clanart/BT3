# Q5838: debt-preview via accrue: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling the utilization the rate is interpolated at, can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `accrue` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the utilization the rate is interpolated at across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `debt-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
