# Q2430: remove_unrooted_slots many-pubkey memory balloon

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove_unrooted_slots` by submit transactions across fast fork churn and then query recent state with many-account write bursts, slot churn, and recent-state queries so that one user can create enough cache/index state through attacker-owned accounts to exhaust memory faster than cleanup responds, breaking the invariant that attacker-owned account fanout must not create unbounded cache or index growth and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::remove_unrooted_slots
- Entrypoint: submit transactions across fast fork churn and then query recent state
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts, slot churn, and recent-state queries
- Exploit idea: use many small valid accounts as the amplifier
- Invariant to test: attacker-owned account fanout must not create unbounded cache or index growth
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: create many valid attacker-controlled accounts and track cache/index growth
