# Q3639: mWOMSVBaseRewarder.getRewards - forfeit erased by settling during cooldown

## Question
rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol: _calExpireForfeit() multiplies the pending amount by mWOMSV.getRewardablePercentWAD(_account), which stays at exactly 1e18 for the whole cooldown window, so a user who has already started their exit forfeits nothing. Under totalStaked is zero and queuedRewards holds a backlog, is there an unprivileged sequence of `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` that leaves `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` unreconciled with `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored`, violates the invariant that the forfeit must reflect the lock commitment actually served, not the settlement instant the user chose, and delivers High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: forfeit erased by settling during cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: _calExpireForfeit() multiplies the pending amount by mWOMSV.getRewardablePercentWAD(_account), which stays at exactly 1e18 for the whole cooldown window, so a user who has already started their exit forfeits nothing. Precondition: totalStaked is zero and queuedRewards holds a backlog.
- Invariant to test: the forfeit must reflect the lock commitment actually served, not the settlement instant the user chose; concretely, `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` must stay reconciled with `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` sequence atomically under totalStaked is zero and queuedRewards holds a backlog, asserting at the end that `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` still equals `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
