# Q1598: NEAR omni-types address/string utilities canonical token identity collision via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public transfer, proof, and token-mapping flows through every chain adapter` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `near/omni-types/src/lib.rs plus `hex_types.rs`, `sol_address.rs`, and `utils.rs`` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `canonical token identity collision` under converts user-controlled recipient strings and proof-derived addresses into typed `OmniAddress` values used throughout the bridge, violating `cross-chain address normalization must never let two textual encodings collapse onto one asset identity or one textual recipient resolve to the wrong chain/account`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-types/src/lib.rs plus `hex_types.rs`, `sol_address.rs`, and `utils.rs``
- Entrypoint: `public transfer, proof, and token-mapping flows through every chain adapter`
- Attacker controls: address strings, hex encodings, account ids, chain-kind tags, and recipient parsing across chains
- Exploit idea: Target hashed token ids, deterministic synthetic addresses, PDA seeds, and address-to-token maps. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: cross-chain address normalization must never let two textual encodings collapse onto one asset identity or one textual recipient resolve to the wrong chain/account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Search for collisions and alias conditions and assert that two distinct remote assets cannot share one local token identity or mapping row. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
