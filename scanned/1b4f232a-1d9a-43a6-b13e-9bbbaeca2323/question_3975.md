# Q3975: respond_to_invalid_shopify_id_token: A `shopify-reload` value that is an absolute off-site URL echoe...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the full query string (minus id_token), `shop`, `host`, and the `shopify-reload` param) reach `respond_to_invalid_shopify_id_token / redirect_to_bounce_page` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb via an embedded GET with an invalid/missing id_token that triggers the bounce redirect, supplying a `shopify-reload` value that is an absolute off-site URL echoed into the redirect, so that the bounce/reload target must stay on the app origin and carry no attacker absolute URL is violated, leading to open redirect carrying a fresh session token to an attacker origin? Specifically confirm that the full public-route flow yields only a rejection or attacker-own-scope result.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb — `respond_to_invalid_shopify_id_token / redirect_to_bounce_page`
- Entrypoint: an embedded GET with an invalid/missing id_token that triggers the bounce redirect
- Attacker controls: the full query string (minus id_token), `shop`, `host`, and the `shopify-reload` param — specifically a `shopify-reload` value that is an absolute off-site URL echoed into the redirect.
- Exploit idea: Run the full public route end-to-end with the crafted input and confirm the real-world outcome is safe.
- Invariant to test: the bounce/reload target must stay on the app origin and carry no attacker absolute URL
- Expected Immunefi impact: open redirect carrying a fresh session token to an attacker origin (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: end-to-end integration test through the real route asserting the attacker outcome is a reject/own-scope only.
