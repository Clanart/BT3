# Q4732: total-supply-preview via collateral-remove-redeem: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
