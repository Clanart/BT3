# Q1532: check_fee_payer_unlocked signature-cache inconsistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `check_fee_payer_unlocked` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with fee-payer aliases, duplicate accounts, rent edge cases, and batch ordering such that a signature can become cached or cleared in a way that disagrees with actual execution or rollback outcome, breaking the invariant that signature caches must reflect executed and committed reality only and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/banking_stage/consumer.rs::check_fee_payer_unlocked
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: fee-payer aliases, duplicate accounts, rent edge cases, and batch ordering
- Exploit idea: look for cache mutations on paths that later fail or retry
- Invariant to test: signature caches must reflect executed and committed reality only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace signature-cache updates while forcing retries, conflicts, and late failures
