# Q1892: Confuse replacement linkage in aggregator_deposit_nonce_stream_creation_verifier_timeout

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` so `aggregator_deposit_nonce_stream_creation_verifier_timeout` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the nofn aggregate key and covenant context to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/rpc/aggregator.rs::aggregator_deposit_nonce_stream_creation_verifier_timeout
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
