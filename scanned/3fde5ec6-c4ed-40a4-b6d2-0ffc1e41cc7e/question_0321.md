# Q321: getTokenAccountsByDelegate downstream queue coupling

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `getTokenAccountsByDelegate` within the single-client low-rate model and choose filtered query params, account/pubkey inputs, encoding flags, and a node where the relevant secondary index is enabled such that `get_token_accounts_by_delegate` triggers a path where one request here triggers enough downstream work to inflate unrelated queues or watchers, violating the invariant that one request should not explode unrelated internal work queues and causing `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc.rs::get_token_accounts_by_delegate
- Entrypoint: JSON-RPC `getTokenAccountsByDelegate` from a single unauthenticated client at no more than once per `CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET / 2`
- Attacker controls: filtered query params, account/pubkey inputs, encoding flags, and a node where the relevant secondary index is enabled
- Exploit idea: trace the queues behind the API, not just the immediate method body
- Invariant to test: one request should not explode unrelated internal work queues
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: instrument downstream queue lengths while replaying one heavy call shape
