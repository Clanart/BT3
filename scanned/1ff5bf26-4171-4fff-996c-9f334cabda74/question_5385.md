# Q5385: calc-liq-factor-exp via liquidate: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `debt-amount`, drive `calc-liq-factor-exp` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:708) — which uses `(/ exp BPS)` as an integer exponent for `pow` and falls back to `sqrti` below BPS — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:708` -> `calc-liq-factor-exp`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-exp` uses `(/ exp BPS)` as an integer exponent for `pow` and falls back to `sqrti` below BPS. Reach it through `liquidate` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-liq-factor-exp` touches, run `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
