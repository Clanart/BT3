# Q913: to clvm accept invalid consensus data via CLVM atoms with redundant sign bytes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker decode attacker-controlled CLVM targeting `to_clvm` in `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs` with CLVM atoms with redundant sign bytes when the same payload is parsed through public bindings make chia_rs accept invalid consensus data, violating the invariant that CLVM atom encodings have canonical typed meanings, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs:65` / `to_clvm`
- Entrypoint: decode attacker-controlled CLVM
- Attacker controls: CLVM atoms with redundant sign bytes
- Exploit idea: Drive `to_clvm` through its public caller path using CLVM atoms with redundant sign bytes; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: CLVM atom encodings have canonical typed meanings
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption
- Fast validation: differential-test curried tree hash against executing the curried program.
