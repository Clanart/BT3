# Q1047: resolve-or-create via collateral-remove: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-or-create` touches, run `collateral-remove` with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
