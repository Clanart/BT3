# Q462: Keeper.CalculateBaseFee - Parentgasused From Blockgaswanted Can Be Manipulated Below Actual Gas Used

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker fill adjacent blocks with carefully priced public transactions through `BeginBlock base-fee calculation from previous block gas` while controlling `EnableHeight` and `block gas wanted`, under the precondition that two adjacent blocks are filled with public transactions, drive `EndBlock BlockGasWanted -> BeginBlock CalculateBaseFee -> VerifyFee -> ApplyTransaction` in `x/feemarket/keeper/eip1559.go::Keeper.CalculateBaseFee` so that parentGasUsed from BlockGasWanted can be manipulated below actual gas used, violating the invariant that MinGasPrice must remain a lower bound for accepted txs, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/feemarket/keeper/eip1559.go::Keeper.CalculateBaseFee`
- Entrypoint: `BeginBlock base-fee calculation from previous block gas`
- Attacker controls: `EnableHeight`, `block gas wanted`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: parentGasUsed from BlockGasWanted can be manipulated below actual gas used through `EndBlock BlockGasWanted -> BeginBlock CalculateBaseFee -> VerifyFee -> ApplyTransaction`.
- Invariant to test: MinGasPrice must remain a lower bound for accepted txs.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: add a fuzz case varying the attacker-controlled fields and differential-check against go-ethereum for tx validity, gas, nonce, and code/storage effects.
