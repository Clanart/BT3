# Q2160: Substitute a wrong proof path into commit

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker substitute part of attacker-controlled multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context so `commit` accepts a proof, header, or path that should have been rejected, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/common/zkvm.rs::commit
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: swap part of attacker-controlled multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context while keeping the rest seemingly valid
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
