# Q3932: NEAR omitted storage-check result helper captured predecessor identity can be abused for fee payout via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public finalize and fast-transfer callbacks after storage payment checks` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::check_storage_balance_result and callback consumers` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `captured predecessor identity can be abused for fee payout` under interprets callback results from storage-balance checks to decide whether recipient and fee-recipient storage exists, violating `callback-result interpretation must not let a missing or reordered storage check masquerade as success and push settlement into an underprepared recipient account`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::check_storage_balance_result and callback consumers`
- Entrypoint: `public finalize and fast-transfer callbacks after storage payment checks`
- Attacker controls: storage action count, callback result size, and chosen index for recipient/fee-recipient checks
- Exploit idea: Attack callbacks that carry caller identity as an argument across promises instead of re-reading a trusted on-chain source. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: callback-result interpretation must not let a missing or reordered storage check masquerade as success and push settlement into an underprepared recipient account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Try nested calls and intermediary contracts and assert that callback arguments cannot redirect fee entitlement away from the authentic proof subject. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
