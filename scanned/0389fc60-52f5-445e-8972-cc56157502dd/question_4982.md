# Q4982: WombatPoolHelperV2.depositFor - receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `depositFor(uint256 _amount, address _for)` under the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling and force `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` apart from `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`, breaking the invariant that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution for Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `depositFor(uint256 _amount, address _for)` (mechanism: receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositFor(uint256 _amount, address _for)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _for (any address) and _amount, with _minimumLiquidity hardcoded to zero
- Exploit idea: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Precondition: the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling.
- Invariant to test: the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, have the attacker run `depositFor(uint256 _amount, address _for)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` versus `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
