# Q3174: Starknet transfer payload Borsh encoding replay state keyed too narrowly for the true domain at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public `fin_transfer` signature path` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `starknet/src/bridge_types.cairo::TransferMessagePayloadTrait and related encoding` violate `payload encoding must stay in lockstep with Near and EVM so Starknet signatures cannot authorize a different transfer off-chain than on-chain` in the `replay state keyed too narrowly for the true domain` attack class because encodes Starknet transfer payload fields into Borsh bytes that are Keccak-hashed for signature verification becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/bridge_types.cairo::TransferMessagePayloadTrait and related encoding`
- Entrypoint: `public `fin_transfer` signature path`
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, origin chain, origin nonce, token address, amount, recipient, fee recipient, and message
- Exploit idea: Look for nonce-only or bucket-only replay keys where the full economic domain includes more fields. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: payload encoding must stay in lockstep with Near and EVM so Starknet signatures cannot authorize a different transfer off-chain than on-chain
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Construct distinct valid events that share the same nonce-like field and assert that settling one does not block or authorize the other incorrectly. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
