# Q2279: BribeRewardPool.stakeFor - queued backlog while totalSupply is zero

## Question
rewards/BribeRewardPool.sol - _provisionReward() accumulates into queuedRewards whenever totalSupply is zero and releases the entire backlog on the next provision, so the first voter after a quiet period absorbs it. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling the delta and the beneficiary, both chosen by the voter calling vote, under the bribe token has begun reverting on transfer, exploit this through `stakeFor(address _for, uint256 _amount) via WombatBribeManager.vote` to break the reconciliation between `_balances[account]` and `totalSupply` and the invariant that a backlog accrued with no voters must not be assignable to a single one-block voter, yielding Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BribeRewardPool.sol -> `stakeFor(address _for, uint256 _amount) via WombatBribeManager.vote` (mechanism: queued backlog while totalSupply is zero)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `stakeFor(address _for, uint256 _amount) via WombatBribeManager.vote`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the delta and the beneficiary, both chosen by the voter calling vote
- Exploit idea: _provisionReward() accumulates into queuedRewards whenever totalSupply is zero and releases the entire backlog on the next provision, so the first voter after a quiet period absorbs it. Precondition: the bribe token has begun reverting on transfer.
- Invariant to test: a backlog accrued with no voters must not be assignable to a single one-block voter; concretely, `_balances[account]` must stay reconciled with `totalSupply`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (the delta and the beneficiary, both chosen by the voter calling vote) under the bribe token has begun reverting on transfer, asserting on every row that a backlog accrued with no voters must not be assignable to a single one-block voter.
