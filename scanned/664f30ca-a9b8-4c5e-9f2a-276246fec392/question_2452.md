# Q2452: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getReward - forfeit erased by settling during cooldown

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, _calExpireForfeit() multiplies the pending amount by vlMGP.getRewardablePercentWAD(_account), which stays at exactly 1e18 for the whole cooldown window, so a user who has already started their exit forfeits nothing. Does `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the computed forfeit lands just above the _amount / 1000 dust threshold, so that `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` diverges from `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`, the invariant that the forfeit must reflect the lock commitment actually served, not the settlement instant the user chose is broken, and the result is High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: forfeit erased by settling during cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the settlement timing, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim and through the locker's unlock path
- Exploit idea: _calExpireForfeit() multiplies the pending amount by vlMGP.getRewardablePercentWAD(_account), which stays at exactly 1e18 for the whole cooldown window, so a user who has already started their exit forfeits nothing. Precondition: the computed forfeit lands just above the _amount / 1000 dust threshold.
- Invariant to test: the forfeit must reflect the lock commitment actually served, not the settlement instant the user chose; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` sequence atomically under the computed forfeit lands just above the _amount / 1000 dust threshold, asserting at the end that `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` still equals `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
