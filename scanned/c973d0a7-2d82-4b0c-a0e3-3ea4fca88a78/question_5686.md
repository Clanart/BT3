# Q5686: is_coinbase_tx: fee/size rate miscomputed by a cast

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `is_coinbase_tx` (in `stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/transactions.rs`) via a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions), such that `fee / tx_size` under-counts due to a size mismatch between decoded and re-encoded tx, breaking the invariant that the size a tx is judged by == its canonical serialized size — leading to fee-floor bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/transactions.rs` -> `is_coinbase_tx`
- Entrypoint: a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions)
- Attacker controls: the full auth structure (singlesig/multisig/order-independent/sponsored), nonce, fee, chain id, version, payload, and post-condition list, plus mutation of their own signed transactions
- Exploit idea: `fee / tx_size` under-counts due to a size mismatch between decoded and re-encoded tx
- Invariant to test: the size a tx is judged by == its canonical serialized size
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - fee-floor bypass
- Fast validation: test a tx whose decode/encode sizes differ
