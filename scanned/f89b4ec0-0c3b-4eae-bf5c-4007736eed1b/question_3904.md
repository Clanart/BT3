# Q3904: from clvm mis-order operations across a batch via big integer encodings

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker derive typed values from CLVM nodes targeting `from_clvm` in `crates/clvm-traits/src/from_clvm.rs` with big integer encodings when values sit exactly at max/min integer boundaries make chia_rs mis-order operations across a batch, violating the invariant that FromClvm and ToClvm round trips preserve semantics, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-traits/src/from_clvm.rs:11` / `from_clvm`
- Entrypoint: derive typed values from CLVM nodes
- Attacker controls: big integer encodings
- Exploit idea: Drive `from_clvm` through its public caller path using big integer encodings; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: FromClvm and ToClvm round trips preserve semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption
- Fast validation: differential-test curried tree hash against executing the curried program.
