# Q4836: total-supply-preview via deposit: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge reach `total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `deposit` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `total-supply-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
