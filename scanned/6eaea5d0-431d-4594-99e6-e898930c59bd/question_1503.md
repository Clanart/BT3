# Q1503: process_and_record_aged_transactions slow-path crash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_and_record_aged_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with aged blockhashes, durable nonces, conflicting write sets, and batch scheduling order such that validly encoded attacker transactions can still reach an assertion, panic, or fatal allocation path through this function, breaking the invariant that user transactions must not be able to crash the validator through this path and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/banking_stage/consumer.rs::process_and_record_aged_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: aged blockhashes, durable nonces, conflicting write sets, and batch scheduling order
- Exploit idea: treat the function as a crash surface as well as a logic surface
- Invariant to test: user transactions must not be able to crash the validator through this path
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: fuzz only valid transaction shapes that reach this function and stop on crashes
