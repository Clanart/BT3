# Q1242: Replay context into citrea_reveal_rbf_bumpfee_increases_feerate_and_mines

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync with attacker-controlled light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes so `citrea_reveal_rbf_bumpfee_increases_feerate_and_mines` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the L1/L2 height pair treated as finalized and safe to bridge against to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/tests.rs::citrea_reveal_rbf_bumpfee_increases_feerate_and_mines
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
