# Q5723: WombatBribeManager.unvote - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
In wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Starting from a state where the bribe contract for the pool registers more than one reward token, can an unprivileged EOA use `unvote(address _lp)` to leave `userTotalVotedInVlmgp[msg.sender]` inconsistent with `IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(msg.sender)`, violating the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates and extracting Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `unvote(address _lp)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `unvote(address _lp)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lp and the moment the whole position on that pool is released
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the bribe contract for the pool registers more than one reward token.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `userTotalVotedInVlmgp[msg.sender]` must stay reconciled with `IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(msg.sender)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_lp and the moment the whole position on that pool is released) under the bribe contract for the pool registers more than one reward token, asserting on every row that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates.
