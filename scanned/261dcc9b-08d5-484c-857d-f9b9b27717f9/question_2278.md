# Q2278: Confuse replacement linkage in get_block_proof_by_hash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering so `get_block_proof_by_hash` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the operator signature set attached to a deposit to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/header_chain_prover.rs::get_block_proof_by_hash
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
