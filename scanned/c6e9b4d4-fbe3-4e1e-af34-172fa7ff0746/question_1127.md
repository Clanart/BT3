# Q1127: WombatPoolHelperV2.deposit - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, where the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Assuming the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, breaking the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value and producing Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, have the attacker run `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` versus `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
