# Q2952: StateDB.AddBalance - Bank Credit Commits Through Native Cache After Evm Revert

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker execute a contract that moves EVM-denom value through nested calls through `EVM balance credit from CALL, SELFDESTRUCT, reward, or refund` while controlling `CALL value` and `SELFDESTRUCT target`, under the precondition that a contract performs nested value transfers and SELFDESTRUCT, drive `StateDB balance operation -> ExecuteNativeAction -> journal append -> Commit` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.AddBalance` so that bank credit commits through native cache after EVM revert, violating the invariant that SELFDESTRUCT must not leave withdrawable balances in deleted accounts, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.AddBalance`
- Entrypoint: `EVM balance credit from CALL, SELFDESTRUCT, reward, or refund`
- Attacker controls: `CALL value`, `SELFDESTRUCT target`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: bank credit commits through native cache after EVM revert through `StateDB balance operation -> ExecuteNativeAction -> journal append -> Commit`.
- Invariant to test: SELFDESTRUCT must not leave withdrawable balances in deleted accounts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: add a fuzz case varying the attacker-controlled fields and differential-check against go-ethereum for tx validity, gas, nonce, and code/storage effects.
