# Q2936: unpack-u16 via call-ststx-ratio: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block reach `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `call-ststx-ratio` twice with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block varied, and assert that the value `unpack-u16` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
