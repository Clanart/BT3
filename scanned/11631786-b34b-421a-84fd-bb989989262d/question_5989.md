# Q5989: population via liquidate: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, drive `population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) — which counts set bits to order the bucket search — to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, breaking the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `liquidate` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, then read `population` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
