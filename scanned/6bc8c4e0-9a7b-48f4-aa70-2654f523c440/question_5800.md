# Q5800: calc-index-next via deposit: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge reach `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it applies a multiplier to the current index, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `deposit` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
