# Q5578: insert via supply-collateral-add: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, can an unprivileged attacker make `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
