# Q1171: calc-principal-ratio-reduction via deposit: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`calc-principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191) reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing `min-out`, use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191` -> `calc-principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Reach it through `deposit` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `deposit` with `min-out`, then read `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
