# Q5923: receive-tokens via repay: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
`receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) pulls an asset from a named account. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), use that to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `repay` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), then read `receive-tokens` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
