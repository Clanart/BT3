# Q2096: ReferralStorage.registerCode - sqrt factor makes many small accounts dominate the denominator

## Question
rewards/ReferralStorage.sol - userInfo.factor is DSMath.sqrt(lockedAmount), so splitting one lock across many addresses raises the summed factor relative to a single large lock and shifts the shared BoostPoint toward the splitter. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling any unclaimed 32-byte code, and how many times registration is repeated, under the attacker locked vlMGP before registering a code, exploit this through `registerCode(bytes32 _code)` to break the reconciliation between `userInfos[account].factor` and `DSMath.sqrt(IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(account))` and the invariant that a boost weight must not reward splitting one position across addresses, yielding High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/ReferralStorage.sol -> `registerCode(bytes32 _code)` (mechanism: sqrt factor makes many small accounts dominate the denominator)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `registerCode(bytes32 _code)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: any unclaimed 32-byte code, and how many times registration is repeated
- Exploit idea: userInfo.factor is DSMath.sqrt(lockedAmount), so splitting one lock across many addresses raises the summed factor relative to a single large lock and shifts the shared BoostPoint toward the splitter. Precondition: the attacker locked vlMGP before registering a code.
- Invariant to test: a boost weight must not reward splitting one position across addresses; concretely, `userInfos[account].factor` must stay reconciled with `DSMath.sqrt(IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(account))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the attacker locked vlMGP before registering a code, have the attacker run `registerCode(bytes32 _code)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `userInfos[account].factor` versus `DSMath.sqrt(IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(account))` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
