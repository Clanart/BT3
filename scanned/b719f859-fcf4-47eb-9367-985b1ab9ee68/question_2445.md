# Q2445: get_pubkey_account_for_slot write-cache ordering drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `get_pubkey_account_for_slot` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads while transactions keep rewriting one pubkey with same-pubkey rewrites across slots, immediate reads, and cached-versus-storage lookups so that writeback ordering can make later readers observe a different account version than accounting code assumed, breaking the invariant that write-cache ordering must preserve one coherent latest-account view and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::get_pubkey_account_for_slot
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads while transactions keep rewriting one pubkey
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey rewrites across slots, immediate reads, and cached-versus-storage lookups
- Exploit idea: search for ordering-sensitive reads around flush/writeback boundaries
- Invariant to test: write-cache ordering must preserve one coherent latest-account view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace storage writes and immediate reads during slot/root churn
