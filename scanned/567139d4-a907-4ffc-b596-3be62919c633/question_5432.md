# Q5432: `verify` and header-chain continuity rules

## Question
Can a prover feed `verify` in `circuits-lib/src/common/zkvm.rs` a header sequence that satisfies its continuity, difficulty or timestamp checks while not being a real Bitcoin chain - a retarget boundary off by one, a timestamp median edge case, a `bits` value the circuit accepts but Bitcoin would not - so a cheap fabricated chain is accepted and used to prove inclusion?

## Target
- File/function: `circuits-lib/src/common/zkvm.rs` -> `verify` (This module defines the traits and structures for zkVM guest and host interactions)
- Entrypoint: a fabricated header chain proof -> `verify`
- Attacker controls: the header sequence, its timestamps, bits and retarget boundaries; attacker is an unprivileged party who can broadcast Bitcoin transactions and craft circuit inputs; holds no protocol role or key
- Exploit idea: prove inclusion in a chain that consensus would reject
- Invariant to test: a header sequence accepted by `verify` == a sequence Bitcoin consensus would accept
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of bridged BTC via a forged inclusion/state proof accepted by the bridge circuit
- Fast validation: feed boundary retarget/timestamp sequences and assert parity with consensus rules
