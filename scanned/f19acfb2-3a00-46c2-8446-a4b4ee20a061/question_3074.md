# Q3074: Corrupt work or canonical ordering in calculate_root_with_merkle_proof

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context so `calculate_root_with_merkle_proof` computes or compares work / ordering incorrectly, causing the wrong canonical chain or watchtower result to win, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/merkle_tree.rs::calculate_root_with_merkle_proof
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: make the wrong chain or watchtower result win by shaping multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
