# Q1495: Starknet transfer payload Borsh encoding recipient or fee-recipient rebinding

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit data through `public `fin_transfer` signature path` that makes `starknet/src/bridge_types.cairo::TransferMessagePayloadTrait and related encoding` settle principal to one party but authorize fee claim or callback routing for another due to encodes Starknet transfer payload fields into Borsh bytes that are Keccak-hashed for signature verification, violating `payload encoding must stay in lockstep with Near and EVM so Starknet signatures cannot authorize a different transfer off-chain than on-chain`?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/bridge_types.cairo::TransferMessagePayloadTrait and related encoding`
- Entrypoint: `public `fin_transfer` signature path`
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, origin chain, origin nonce, token address, amount, recipient, fee recipient, and message
- Exploit idea: Exploit optional fee-recipient fields, fast-transfer relayer substitution, or predecessor-captured identities.
- Invariant to test: payload encoding must stay in lockstep with Near and EVM so Starknet signatures cannot authorize a different transfer off-chain than on-chain
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Build pairs of proofs/messages that vary only in recipient-oriented fields and assert that settlement, fee claim, and event emission stay bound to one tuple.
