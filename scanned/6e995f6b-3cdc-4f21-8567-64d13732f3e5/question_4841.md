# Q4841: calc-principal-ratio-reduction via collateral-remove-redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, drive `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191) — which reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt — to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:191` -> `calc-principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `calc-principal-ratio-reduction` reduces scaled principal proportionally to an amount over total debt. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
