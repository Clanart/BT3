# Q1136: zip via redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-out` reach `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with `min-out` varied, and assert that the value `zip` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
