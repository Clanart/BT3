# Q3629: get-available-assets via transfer: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), controlling `amount`, drive `get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) — which reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `transfer` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `transfer` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
