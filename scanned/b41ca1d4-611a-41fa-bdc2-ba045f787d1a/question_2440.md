# Q2440: to clvm collapse distinct inputs into one accepted state via allocator node pairs and atoms

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker decode attacker-controlled CLVM targeting `to_clvm` in `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs` with allocator node pairs and atoms when the same payload is parsed through public bindings make chia_rs collapse distinct inputs into one accepted state, violating the invariant that curried argument hashes match executed programs, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs:124` / `to_clvm`
- Entrypoint: decode attacker-controlled CLVM
- Attacker controls: allocator node pairs and atoms
- Exploit idea: Drive `to_clvm` through its public caller path using allocator node pairs and atoms; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: curried argument hashes match executed programs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption
- Fast validation: fuzz CLVM atoms and lists and assert typed decoding matches clvmr semantics.
