# Q420: Solana log_metadata malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public Solana `log_metadata` instruction` with control over mint account, metadata account contents, payer funding, and published payload fields and desynchronize `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::log_metadata` from the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity` attack class because reads Solana token metadata and posts it back toward Near for cross-chain deployment flows, violating `metadata publication must not let a malicious mint or metadata account manufacture a remote asset identity that diverges from actual custody semantics`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::log_metadata`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `log_metadata` instruction`
- Attacker controls: mint account, metadata account contents, payer funding, and published payload fields
- Exploit idea: Exploit arbitrary token metadata calls, old/new ABI switching, or malformed strings in metadata proofs. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting.
- Invariant to test: metadata publication must not let a malicious mint or metadata account manufacture a remote asset identity that diverges from actual custody semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Publish or prove pathological metadata values and assert that downstream deployment and mapping logic still binds to the right remote asset and decimals. Also assert cross-module consistency between `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::log_metadata` and the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting after every branch.
