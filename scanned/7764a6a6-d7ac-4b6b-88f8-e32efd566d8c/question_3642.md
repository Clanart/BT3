# Q3642: collateral-add via liquidate: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `min-collateral-expected`, can an unprivileged attacker make `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374` -> `collateral-add`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion. Reach it through `liquidate` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-collateral-expected` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `collateral-add` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
