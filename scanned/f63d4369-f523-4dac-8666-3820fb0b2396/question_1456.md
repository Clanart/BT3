# Q1456: Leave reusable partial state in internal_handle_kickoff

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker force a partial failure around the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context and then resume auth-bypass attempt into gRPC `ClementineVerifier.InternalHandleKickoff` so `internal_handle_kickoff` continues from stale intermediate state, causing the verifier nonce session that a final signature is supposed to consume to diverge from the canonical bridge context and breaking the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/rpc/verifier.rs::internal_handle_kickoff
- Entrypoint: auth-bypass attempt into gRPC `ClementineVerifier.InternalHandleKickoff`
- Attacker controls: the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure around the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context and then resume under changed state
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
