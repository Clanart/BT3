# Q2624: Duplicate queue or processing state in txid

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `txid` twice with attacker-controlled the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the storage-proof key/value binding used for deposit or withdrawal validation and violating the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/transaction.rs::txid
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
