# Q936: Misbind trusted context inside round_tx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `round_tx` through public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline and make attacker-controlled the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit` bind to the wrong trusted context, so the operator signature set attached to a deposit is interpreted for one bridge action while authorizing another, violating the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/states/round.rs::round_tx
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit`
- Exploit idea: bind attacker-controlled the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit` to the wrong trusted bridge context
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
