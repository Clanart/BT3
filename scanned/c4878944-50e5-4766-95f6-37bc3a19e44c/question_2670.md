# Q2670: Accept wrong proof/network context in insert_reveal_try_to_send

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes through user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync so `insert_reveal_try_to_send` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the linkage between Citrea state and a replacement deposit move transaction and breaking the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/sync.rs::insert_reveal_try_to_send
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
