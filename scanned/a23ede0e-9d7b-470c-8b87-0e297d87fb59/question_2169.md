# Q2169: population via collateral-add: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), drive `population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) — which counts set bits to order the bucket search — to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, breaking the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `collateral-add` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `population` touches, run `collateral-add` with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
