# Q3110: put_call_frames can serve state that disagrees with the cache (mem_pool.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `put_call_frames` in `program-runtime/src/mem_pool.rs` with an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation, and make the program bytecode verified at deploy time disagree with the bytecode executed from the program cache, so that the invariant "Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/mem_pool.rs` -> `put_call_frames()` (around line 156)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation
- Exploit idea: Make `put_call_frames` read a cached value the attacker already invalidated, so a node with a warm cache commits different state than one that reloaded.
- Invariant to test: Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Test the path with the cache primed and cleared; assert the committed state is identical in both runs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy or upgrade a program, or poison the program cache, so honest validators execute different bytecode or produce different results for the same instruction.
