# Q1749: DeductFeeDecorator.AnteHandle - Simulate True Skips Fee Checker But Later Path Commits

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `Cosmos ante fee deduction for txs routed through Ethermint ante` while controlling `gas limit` and `fee cap`, under the precondition that London and Prague rules are active on the target height, drive `VerifyFee -> DeductTxCostsFromUserBalance -> ApplyMessageWithConfig -> RefundGasWithPrice` in `ante/evm/nativefee.go::DeductFeeDecorator.AnteHandle` so that simulate=true skips fee checker but later path commits, violating the invariant that fees deducted, gas consumed, refunds, and fee collector balance must net to the EVM execution result, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `ante/evm/nativefee.go::DeductFeeDecorator.AnteHandle`
- Entrypoint: `Cosmos ante fee deduction for txs routed through Ethermint ante`
- Attacker controls: `gas limit`, `fee cap`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: simulate=true skips fee checker but later path commits through `VerifyFee -> DeductTxCostsFromUserBalance -> ApplyMessageWithConfig -> RefundGasWithPrice`.
- Invariant to test: fees deducted, gas consumed, refunds, and fee collector balance must net to the EVM execution result.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: write a focused Go unit test around the target function and assert bank supply, sender balance, nonce, code hash, logs, and receipt status before and after.
