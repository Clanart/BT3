# Q1700: deserialize_parameters reserved-key bypass

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `deserialize_parameters` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with account layouts, resize patterns, duplicate accounts, and cpi paths that mutate overlapping memory regions such that duplicated accounts or versioned message features let attacker-controlled keys slip past reserved-key assumptions, breaking the invariant that reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/serialization.rs::deserialize_parameters
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: account layouts, resize patterns, duplicate accounts, and CPI paths that mutate overlapping memory regions
- Exploit idea: search for paths where reserved-key checks see a different key set than execution
- Invariant to test: reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: construct versioned transactions whose ALT-expanded account set changes the effective key view
