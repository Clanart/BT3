# Q2652: read_only_accounts_cache.store slot-cache latest drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that cause cache population for large accounts with repeated reads of large or frequently changing accounts so that latest-account selection can choose the wrong slot under same-pubkey churn, breaking the invariant that latest-account resolution must pick the true latest visible slot and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs::store
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that cause cache population for large accounts
- Attacker controls: repeated reads of large or frequently changing accounts
- Exploit idea: target multiple nearby slot writes to one pubkey
- Invariant to test: latest-account resolution must pick the true latest visible slot
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: rewrite one account across nearby slots and verify which version low-rate reads observe
