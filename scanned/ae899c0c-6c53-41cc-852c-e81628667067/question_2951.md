# Q2951: notify_signatures_received root-flush visibility gap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_signatures_received` by subscribe to signatures and then submit many status-changing transactions with signature subscriptions, duplicate-signature churn, and slow consumer behavior so that root advancement and flush state can diverge long enough for readers to observe impossible account histories, breaking the invariant that root visibility and flushed persistence must not diverge in externally observable ways and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_signatures_received
- Entrypoint: subscribe to signatures and then submit many status-changing transactions
- Attacker controls: signature subscriptions, duplicate-signature churn, and slow consumer behavior
- Exploit idea: search for split-brain visibility between rooted and flushed state
- Invariant to test: root visibility and flushed persistence must not diverge in externally observable ways
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: read the same pubkey during root movement and compare rooted versus cached answers
