# Q5471: WombatPoolHelperV2.depositLP - receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` while the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, and drive `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` out of agreement with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` - breaking the invariant that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution - for Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount
- Exploit idea: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_lpAmount) under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, asserting on every row that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution.
