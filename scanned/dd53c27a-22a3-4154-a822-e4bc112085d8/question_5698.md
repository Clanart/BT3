# Q5698: WombatPoolHelper.depositLP - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, where WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Assuming MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `this.balance(msg.sender)` and `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` via `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`, breaking the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding and producing High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` sequence atomically under MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, asserting at the end that `this.balance(msg.sender)` still equals `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
