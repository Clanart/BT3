# Q3434: Solana signed-payload serialization endianness mismatch forks authenticated bytes via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Solana deploy/init/finalize instructions` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/* plus instruction callers` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `endianness mismatch forks authenticated bytes` under serializes deploy, init, and finalize payloads into the bytes that Near later verifies and interprets, violating `serialized payloads must match Near’s decoding byte-for-byte so one Solana event cannot be verified as a different Near-side bridge action`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/* plus instruction callers`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana deploy/init/finalize instructions`
- Attacker controls: all payload fields that are serialized for Near and signed by the derived bridge key
- Exploit idea: Target Borsh helpers and hand-built payload encoders across Rust, Solidity, and Cairo. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: serialized payloads must match Near’s decoding byte-for-byte so one Solana event cannot be verified as a different Near-side bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Cross-generate payloads on every implementation and assert byte-for-byte equality for every field combination that can reach signatures or proofs. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
