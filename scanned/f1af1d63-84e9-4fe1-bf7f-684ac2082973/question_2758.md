# Q2758: NEAR init_transfer_internal native versus wrapped branch switch via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `internal path reached from public `ft_on_transfer` and resume logic` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_internal` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `native versus wrapped branch switch` under stores the transfer, updates storage balances, burns deployed tokens when needed, locks tokens for non-origin chains, and emits `InitTransfer`, violating `every outbound transfer must either roll back cleanly or leave one fully-backed pending transfer record with the right lock and burn semantics`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_internal`
- Entrypoint: `internal path reached from public `ft_on_transfer` and resume logic`
- Attacker controls: stored transfer contents, storage owner, token id, amount, fee, and destination chain
- Exploit idea: Target zero-address, deployed-token, custom-minter, native-vault, or bridge-token branch predicates. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: every outbound transfer must either roll back cleanly or leave one fully-backed pending transfer record with the right lock and burn semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each branch predicate to flip around callbacks or mapping writes and assert that the same source asset can never produce two incompatible custody models. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
