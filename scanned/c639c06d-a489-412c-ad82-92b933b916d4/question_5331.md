# Q5331: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.deposit - receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary

## Question
Consider wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, where _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Assuming the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` and `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, breaking the invariant that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution and producing Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity) under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, asserting on every row that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution.
