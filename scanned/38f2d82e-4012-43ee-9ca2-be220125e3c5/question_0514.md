# Q0514: accrue via call-ststx-ratio: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835` -> `accrue`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `call-ststx-ratio` with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
