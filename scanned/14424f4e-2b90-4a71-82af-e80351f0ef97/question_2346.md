# Q2346: accounts_db.load zero-lamport resurrection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by submit transactions or make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that force repeated account lookups with high-churn account creation/close patterns, repeated reads, and same-pubkey updates across nearby slots so that dead or zero-lamport accounts can survive or reappear because cleanup and load paths disagree, breaking the invariant that closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::load
- Entrypoint: submit transactions or make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that force repeated account lookups
- Attacker controls: high-churn account creation/close patterns, repeated reads, and same-pubkey updates across nearby slots
- Exploit idea: look for stale dead-account visibility after close/recreate churn
- Invariant to test: closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: close and recreate the same attacker-controlled account shape repeatedly
