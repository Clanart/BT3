# Q1232: EVM OmniBridge logMetadata native versus wrapped registration confusion at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public EVM metadata logging entrypoint` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::logMetadata` violate `metadata logging must not let malicious token contracts create bridge-side asset identities or deployment proofs that can later mint or map the wrong asset` in the `native versus wrapped registration confusion` attack class because reads metadata from an arbitrary ERC-20-like token, passes it to `logMetadataExtension`, and emits a `LogMetadata` event becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::logMetadata`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM metadata logging entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: token contract address, token-reported `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, and msg.value for extensions
- Exploit idea: Target vault-existence checks, deployed-token caches, origin-chain inference, and custom-minter registration. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: metadata logging must not let malicious token contracts create bridge-side asset identities or deployment proofs that can later mint or map the wrong asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Flip each classification predicate around existing mappings and assert that deployment and later settlement always preserve the same custody model. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
