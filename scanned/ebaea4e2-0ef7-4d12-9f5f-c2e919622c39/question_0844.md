# Q844: resanitize_transaction_minimally alias lock divergence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `resanitize_transaction_minimally` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction`, `simulatetransaction`, or direct tpu quic with versioned messages, address lookup tables, duplicated accounts, and boundary serialization forms such that duplicated writable/read-only aliases and ALT-expanded account lists make the lock view here differ from the later execution or commit view, breaking the invariant that a transaction must have one canonical writable/read-only account view from sanitize through commit and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::resanitize_transaction_minimally
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction`, `simulateTransaction`, or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, address lookup tables, duplicated accounts, and boundary serialization forms
- Exploit idea: turn one logical account set into two inconsistent internal views so conflict detection is bypassed or retries spin forever
- Invariant to test: a transaction must have one canonical writable/read-only account view from sanitize through commit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace the lock set, loaded account set, and committed writes for ALT-heavy duplicated-account transactions
