# Q2706: accounts_cache.store same-pubkey churn hotspot

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store` by submit transactions that update many accounts in one slot with many writable accounts, repeated same-pubkey writes, and slot-boundary churn so that rewriting one pubkey repeatedly creates pathological behavior that normal multi-pubkey load does not, breaking the invariant that hot-key churn should not create correctness or performance pathologies and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::store
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that update many accounts in one slot
- Attacker controls: many writable accounts, repeated same-pubkey writes, and slot-boundary churn
- Exploit idea: use hot-key churn rather than broad fanout
- Invariant to test: hot-key churn should not create correctness or performance pathologies
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: compare same-pubkey rewrite churn against equally large multi-pubkey churn
