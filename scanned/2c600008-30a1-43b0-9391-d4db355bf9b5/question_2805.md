# Q2805: roots_to_flush many-pubkey memory balloon

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `roots_to_flush` by submit transactions that keep many roots dirty while reading hot accounts with heavy write churn across nearby roots plus immediate reads so that one user can create enough cache/index state through attacker-owned accounts to exhaust memory faster than cleanup responds, breaking the invariant that attacker-owned account fanout must not create unbounded cache or index growth and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::roots_to_flush
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that keep many roots dirty while reading hot accounts
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn across nearby roots plus immediate reads
- Exploit idea: use many small valid accounts as the amplifier
- Invariant to test: attacker-owned account fanout must not create unbounded cache or index growth
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: create many valid attacker-controlled accounts and track cache/index growth
