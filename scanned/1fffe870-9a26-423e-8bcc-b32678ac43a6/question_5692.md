# Q5692: WombatPoolHelper.depositLP - stray receipt tokens on the helper are swept into the next deposit

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, the balance-delta measurement in _deposit() and depositLP() assumes the helper holds no unattributed stakingToken, so any receipt token left there by a partial mint, a rounding residue or a direct transfer is credited to the next depositor. Does `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, so that `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` diverges from `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, the invariant that a helper must never credit a depositor with receipt tokens it did not mint for that deposit is broken, and the result is Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: stray receipt tokens on the helper are swept into the next deposit)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller
- Exploit idea: the balance-delta measurement in _deposit() and depositLP() assumes the helper holds no unattributed stakingToken, so any receipt token left there by a partial mint, a rounding residue or a direct transfer is credited to the next depositor. Precondition: MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed.
- Invariant to test: a helper must never credit a depositor with receipt tokens it did not mint for that deposit; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, have the attacker run `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` versus `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
