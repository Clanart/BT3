# Q0084: filter-out-debt-asset via liquidate-multi: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the trait principals supplied per entry across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `filter-out-debt-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
