# Q5028: find via liquidate: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted reach `find` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135` -> `find`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `find` resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map. Reach it through `liquidate` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `find` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
