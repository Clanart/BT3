# Q5751: process-collateral-asset via liquidate-multi: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
`process-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:789) computes expected collateral, then caps it at the borrower's balance. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:789` -> `process-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `process-collateral-asset` computes expected collateral, then caps it at the borrower's balance. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `process-collateral-asset` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
