# Q4182: next-index via liquidate-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the redemption receiver across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `next-index` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
