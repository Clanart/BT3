# Q0798: vault-system-repay via liquidate: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `vault-system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `vault-system-repay` routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207` -> `vault-system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-repay` routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `vault-system-repay` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
