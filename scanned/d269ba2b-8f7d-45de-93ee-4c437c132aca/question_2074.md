# Q2074: remove-user-collateral via collateral-remove-redeem: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, can an unprivileged attacker make `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
