# Q846: Race calculate_required_fee across concurrent state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch, retry, or reorder public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction interactions around the `signed_tx_hex` payload so `calculate_required_fee` observes inconsistent state across memory, database, and on-chain checks, breaking the invariant that queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent, and leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/lib.rs::calculate_required_fee
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Exploit idea: use retries, batching, or timing around the `signed_tx_hex` payload to desynchronize state
- Invariant to test: queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
