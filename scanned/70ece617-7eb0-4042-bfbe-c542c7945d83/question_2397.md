# Q2397: flush_accounts_cache index inconsistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `flush_accounts_cache` by submit transactions that touch many writable accounts and then query them immediately with many-account write bursts, slot churn, and immediate read-after-write rpcs so that indexes or lookup tables updated around this function can disagree with the stored account payloads they point to, breaking the invariant that indexes must resolve to the exact account version later returned to rpc or runtime callers and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::flush_accounts_cache
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that touch many writable accounts and then query them immediately
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts, slot churn, and immediate read-after-write RPCs
- Exploit idea: force same-pubkey and same-owner churn to look for torn index state
- Invariant to test: indexes must resolve to the exact account version later returned to RPC or runtime callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare indexed reads to direct storage reads during high-churn updates
