# Q2520: os_carried_outputs_new message replay or skip in output.cairo (mode/version split)

## Question
Can a malicious user transaction set shaping storage writes, messages, class declarations, and block-level state diffs use message payloads, message ordering, message-triggered calldata, the shape of the resulting state diff through crafted valid transactions to make `os_carried_outputs_new` in `crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/output.cairo` consume or emit an L1/L2 message under a key, payload, or ordering that is not the same one earlier checked or later committed around L1/L2 message uniqueness and accounting, so that honest StarkNet OS execution commits, emits, or accepts an attacker-favorable result that reaches direct loss of funds? Can validate/execute mode, deprecated/new code paths, or output-mode switches make honest executions disagree on the same public input?

## Target
- File/function: crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/output.cairo:147 :: os_carried_outputs_new
- Entrypoint: malicious user transaction set shaping storage writes, messages, class declarations, and block-level state diffs
- Attacker controls: message payloads, message ordering, message-triggered calldata, the shape of the resulting state diff through crafted valid transactions
- Exploit idea: make message uniqueness depend on one header/payload view while output serialization or consumption uses another while this function is handling L1/L2 message uniqueness and accounting. Exploit a mode, version, or output-format split so one phase authorizes a behavior that another phase commits differently.
- Invariant to test: a message must be consumed or emitted exactly once under one canonical header/payload hash and must not be skipped, duplicated, or rebound to a different destination All supported modes and versions must preserve one canonical authorization and commitment result for the same accepted public input.
- Expected bounty impact: Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: exercise attacker-controlled payload lengths, nested calls, and revert edges through this function, then assert the message ledger/output contains exactly one canonical effect per accepted message Cross-test the old/new or validate/execute variants with the same public input and assert they cannot commit divergent results.
