# Q1666: mWOM.convertAndStake - _convert transfers WOM before the veWOM lock is confirmed

## Question
In wombat/mWOM.sol, for the _doConvert path, _convert() sends the WOM to wombatStaking and then calls _lockWom, so the WOM is out of this contract's control before the lock result is known and any third party call to convertAllWom in between changes the attribution. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `convertAndStake(uint256 _amount)` while an owner funding transfer of MGP is sitting in the mempool, and drive `vlMGPAmount = _amount * rewardRatio / DENOMINATOR` out of agreement with `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(address(this))` - breaking the invariant that value must not leave the accounting contract before the step that accounts for it has completed - for Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWOM.sol -> `convertAndStake(uint256 _amount)` (mechanism: _convert transfers WOM before the veWOM lock is confirmed)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `convertAndStake(uint256 _amount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and the helper routing that stakes the freshly minted mWOM
- Exploit idea: for the _doConvert path, _convert() sends the WOM to wombatStaking and then calls _lockWom, so the WOM is out of this contract's control before the lock result is known and any third party call to convertAllWom in between changes the attribution. Precondition: an owner funding transfer of MGP is sitting in the mempool.
- Invariant to test: value must not leave the accounting contract before the step that accounts for it has completed; concretely, `vlMGPAmount = _amount * rewardRatio / DENOMINATOR` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up an owner funding transfer of MGP is sitting in the mempool, snapshot `vlMGPAmount = _amount * rewardRatio / DENOMINATOR` and `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(address(this))`, run the attacker's `convertAndStake(uint256 _amount)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
