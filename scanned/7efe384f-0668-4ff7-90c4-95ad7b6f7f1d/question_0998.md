# Q0998: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getRewards - forfeited value recycled to the same stakers who forfeited it

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, _sendReward() routes forfeitAmount into _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer(), which raises rewardPerTokenStored for everyone currently staked including the forfeiting account, so a dominant staker recovers most of their own forfeit. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` while the account's slot matured recently so the percent has only just begun to decay, and drive `forfeitAmount` out of agreement with `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored` - breaking the invariant that value forfeited on exit must accrue to the users who remained committed, not back to the exiting account - for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: forfeited value recycled to the same stakers who forfeited it)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() routes forfeitAmount into _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer(), which raises rewardPerTokenStored for everyone currently staked including the forfeiting account, so a dominant staker recovers most of their own forfeit. Precondition: the account's slot matured recently so the percent has only just begun to decay.
- Invariant to test: value forfeited on exit must accrue to the users who remained committed, not back to the exiting account; concretely, `forfeitAmount` must stay reconciled with `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor) under the account's slot matured recently so the percent has only just begun to decay, asserting on every row that value forfeited on exit must accrue to the users who remained committed, not back to the exiting account.
