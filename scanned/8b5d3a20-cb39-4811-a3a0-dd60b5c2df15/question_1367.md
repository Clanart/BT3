# Q1367: BlockGasLimit - Unlimited Maxgas Returns Maxuint64 And Overflows Downstream Fee Math

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `block gas limit lookup for EVM execution and estimates` while controlling `baseFee` and `multi-message ordering`, under the precondition that baseFee changed at BeginBlock, drive `baseFee read -> effective fee calculation -> fee escrow -> leftover gas refund` in `types/block.go::BlockGasLimit` so that unlimited MaxGas returns MaxUint64 and overflows downstream fee math, violating the invariant that baseFee and effectiveGasPrice must be consistent across ante, execution, and refund, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `types/block.go::BlockGasLimit`
- Entrypoint: `block gas limit lookup for EVM execution and estimates`
- Attacker controls: `baseFee`, `multi-message ordering`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: unlimited MaxGas returns MaxUint64 and overflows downstream fee math through `baseFee read -> effective fee calculation -> fee escrow -> leftover gas refund`.
- Invariant to test: baseFee and effectiveGasPrice must be consistent across ante, execution, and refund.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: replay the same scenario through eth_call or estimateGas and through eth_sendRawTransaction and assert the only difference is persistence.
