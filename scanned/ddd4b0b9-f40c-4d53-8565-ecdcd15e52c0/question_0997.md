# Q997: EVM init/finalize optional message semantics resume-path replay or duplication via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `initTransfer`, `initTransfer1155`, and `finTransfer`` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol optional `message` handling` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `resume-path replay or duplication` under uses message presence to choose between plain mint and message-based mint on bridge tokens and to include or omit Borsh-encoded message bytes in signatures, violating `optional message semantics must not let an attacker switch the economic branch after the source event is fixed, thereby changing whether callbacks can refund or consume tokens`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol optional `message` handling`
- Entrypoint: `public `initTransfer`, `initTransfer1155`, and `finTransfer``
- Attacker controls: empty versus non-empty message bytes and recipient contracts that react differently to message-carrying mints
- Exploit idea: Abuse yield/resume or asynchronous callback timing so the same pending outbound transfer is restarted after it already progressed. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: optional message semantics must not let an attacker switch the economic branch after the source event is fixed, thereby changing whether callbacks can refund or consume tokens
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trigger timeouts, duplicate funding, and repeated callback delivery and assert that the resumed transfer either progresses once or cleanly fails once. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
