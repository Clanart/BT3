# Q0536: next-liquidity-index via liquidate-multi: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with the trait principals supplied per entry varied, and assert that the value `next-liquidity-index` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
