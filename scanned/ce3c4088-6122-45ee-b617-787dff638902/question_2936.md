# Q2936: receive: A `params.permit!` mass-assignment surface after verification, ...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `:type` route segment, the raw body, and all webhook headers) reach `receive` in app/controllers/shopify_app/webhooks_controller.rb via POST /webhooks/:type, supplying a `params.permit!` mass-assignment surface after verification, injecting unexpected params into downstream handlers, so that the shop-domain header must not be trusted as identity without HMAC binding is violated, leading to cross-shop data spoofing via forged webhook headers? Specifically confirm that the security property holds for the whole generated input class, not just one example.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/webhooks_controller.rb — `receive`
- Entrypoint: POST /webhooks/:type
- Attacker controls: the `:type` route segment, the raw body, and all webhook headers — specifically a `params.permit!` mass-assignment surface after verification, injecting unexpected params into downstream handlers.
- Exploit idea: State the security property as an invariant and check it over a generated range of related inputs.
- Invariant to test: the shop-domain header must not be trusted as identity without HMAC binding
- Expected Immunefi impact: cross-shop data spoofing via forged webhook headers (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: invariant/property test over generated inputs asserting the security property holds universally.
