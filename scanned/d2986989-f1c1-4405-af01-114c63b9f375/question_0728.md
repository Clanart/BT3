# Q0728: merge-price via liquidate-redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the borrower targeted varied, and assert that the value `merge-price` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
