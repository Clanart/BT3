# Q4001: iter-price-multi via liquidate-multi: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `iter-price-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405) — which carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64` — to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:405` -> `iter-price-multi`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `iter-price-multi` carries `aids` and `idx` in its accumulator but never uses them to align prices with asset ids, and appends under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the full batch list and its ordering, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
