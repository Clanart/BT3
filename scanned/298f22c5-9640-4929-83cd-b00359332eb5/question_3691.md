# Q3691: WombatPoolHelper.withdraw - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. With _liquidity and _minAmount, with the payout measured as a balance delta under attacker control and a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, can an unprivileged caller sequence `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` so that `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value and realising Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity and _minAmount, with the payout measured as a balance delta
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, then assert `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` end identical in both runs.
