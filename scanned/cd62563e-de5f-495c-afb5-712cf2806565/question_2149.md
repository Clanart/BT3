# Q2149: NEAR deploy_token callback malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `proof callback for public `deploy_token`` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token_callback` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity` under checks the emitting factory, then calls `deploy_token_internal` using metadata from the validated message, violating `proof-bound metadata must not be replayable or malleable in a way that deploys the wrong token id, wrong decimals, or conflicting mappings`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token_callback`
- Entrypoint: `proof callback for public `deploy_token``
- Attacker controls: decoded `LogMetadata` result, chain kind, token address, metadata contents, and attached deposit
- Exploit idea: Exploit arbitrary token metadata calls, old/new ABI switching, or malformed strings in metadata proofs. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: proof-bound metadata must not be replayable or malleable in a way that deploys the wrong token id, wrong decimals, or conflicting mappings
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Publish or prove pathological metadata values and assert that downstream deployment and mapping logic still binds to the right remote asset and decimals. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
