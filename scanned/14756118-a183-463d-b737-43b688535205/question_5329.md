# Q5329: interpolate-rate via repay: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, drive `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) — which interpolates between packed u16 curve points — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `repay` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, then read `interpolate-rate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
