# Q2985: notify_vote slot-removal liveness bug

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_vote` by subscribe to votes and then drive hot transaction flow that affects vote visibility with vote subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot notification streams so that slot-removal logic can discard account data still needed by later state resolution, breaking the invariant that slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_vote
- Entrypoint: subscribe to votes and then drive hot transaction flow that affects vote visibility
- Attacker controls: vote subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot notification streams
- Exploit idea: target old/new slot overlap for the same pubkey
- Invariant to test: slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn one pubkey across removable and non-removable slots
