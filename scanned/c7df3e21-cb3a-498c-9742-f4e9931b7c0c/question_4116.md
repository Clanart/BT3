# Q4116: accrue via accrue: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block reach `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835` -> `accrue`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale. Reach it through `accrue` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `accrue` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
