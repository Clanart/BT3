# Q2482: generate_index premature frozen-slot assumption

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `generate_index` by submit transactions that create many attacker-controlled accounts with structured keys with many-account creation with common owners/layouts and repeated indexed reads so that this path can treat a slot as finalized for one purpose before all related account state is safely written, breaking the invariant that frozen-slot assumptions must not outpace actual durable state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::generate_index
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that create many attacker-controlled accounts with structured keys
- Attacker controls: many-account creation with common owners/layouts and repeated indexed reads
- Exploit idea: search for early frozen assumptions
- Invariant to test: frozen-slot assumptions must not outpace actual durable state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace slot-freeze transitions and storage durability
