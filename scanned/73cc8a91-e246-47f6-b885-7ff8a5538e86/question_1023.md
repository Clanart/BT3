# Q1023: resolve-price-feed via collateral-remove: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`resolve-price-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332) dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332` -> `resolve-price-feed`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-price-feed` dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-price-feed` touches, run `collateral-remove` with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
