# Q2073: handle_chunks slow-path crash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `handle_chunks` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one client with quic chunk boundaries, packet counts, certificate/pubkey choices, and transaction payload sizes such that validly encoded attacker transactions can still reach an assertion, panic, or fatal allocation path through this function, breaking the invariant that user transactions must not be able to crash the validator through this path and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/nonblocking/quic.rs::handle_chunks
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one client
- Attacker controls: QUIC chunk boundaries, packet counts, certificate/pubkey choices, and transaction payload sizes
- Exploit idea: treat the function as a crash surface as well as a logic surface
- Invariant to test: user transactions must not be able to crash the validator through this path
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: fuzz only valid transaction shapes that reach this function and stop on crashes
