# Q1794: write-feed via call-ststx-ratio: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, can an unprivileged attacker make `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `write-feed` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
