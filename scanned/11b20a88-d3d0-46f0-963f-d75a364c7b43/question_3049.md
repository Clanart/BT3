# Q3049: NEAR bind_token callback native versus wrapped registration confusion at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `proof callback for public `bind_token`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token_callback` violate `a token binding must not be replayable or partially writable in a way that creates duplicate mappings, inconsistent lock rows, or underfunded state` in the `native versus wrapped registration confusion` attack class because adds the token mapping, initializes `locked_tokens` for the foreign asset, measures storage delta, and requires sufficient attached deposit before emitting the bind event becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token_callback`
- Entrypoint: `proof callback for public `bind_token``
- Attacker controls: decoded deploy-token message, chain kind, foreign token address, decimals, origin decimals, and attached deposit
- Exploit idea: Target vault-existence checks, deployed-token caches, origin-chain inference, and custom-minter registration. Concentrate on decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges.
- Invariant to test: a token binding must not be replayable or partially writable in a way that creates duplicate mappings, inconsistent lock rows, or underfunded state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Flip each classification predicate around existing mappings and assert that deployment and later settlement always preserve the same custody model. Sweep boundary values for decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
