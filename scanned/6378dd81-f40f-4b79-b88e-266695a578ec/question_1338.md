# Q1338: store_account_and_update_capitalization rent floor drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store_account_and_update_capitalization` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transactions that create, close, resize, or rewrite many accounts in one batch such that account resize, close, or reopen patterns can use a stale rent-exemption view, breaking the invariant that rent-exemption checks must use the final committed account layout and balance and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::store_account_and_update_capitalization
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transactions that create, close, resize, or rewrite many accounts in one batch
- Exploit idea: search for pre-resize or pre-close rent assumptions that survive too long
- Invariant to test: rent-exemption checks must use the final committed account layout and balance
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: use realloc/close/open patterns and diff rent floor checks against final account sizes
