# Q247: TxListenerDecorator.AnteHandle - Listener Side Effects Survive Rejected Transaction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit, replace, reorder, or batch pending transactions through `ante listener around public tx processing` while controlling `replacement tx` and `signer extraction`, under the precondition that strict nonce ordering is enforced by CometBFT mempool, drive `broadcastTx fallback -> CometBFT BroadcastTx -> FinalizeBlock ante` in `evmd/ante/tx_listener.go::TxListenerDecorator.AnteHandle` so that listener side effects survive rejected transaction, violating the invariant that mempool ordering and signer extraction must match consensus validity, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `evmd/ante/tx_listener.go::TxListenerDecorator.AnteHandle`
- Entrypoint: `ante listener around public tx processing`
- Attacker controls: `replacement tx`, `signer extraction`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: listener side effects survive rejected transaction through `broadcastTx fallback -> CometBFT BroadcastTx -> FinalizeBlock ante`.
- Invariant to test: mempool ordering and signer extraction must match consensus validity.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: write a focused Go unit test around the target function and assert bank supply, sender balance, nonce, code hash, logs, and receipt status before and after.
