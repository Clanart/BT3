# Q2590: mark_slot_frozen hot-stream starvation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `mark_slot_frozen` by submit transactions that maximize write churn near slot boundaries with heavy write churn near slot-freeze boundaries so that one hot account/program/signature stream monopolizes work and starves other subscribers, breaking the invariant that one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::mark_slot_frozen
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that maximize write churn near slot boundaries
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn near slot-freeze boundaries
- Exploit idea: measure cross-subscriber fairness
- Invariant to test: one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: pair a hot stream with a cheap control subscription
