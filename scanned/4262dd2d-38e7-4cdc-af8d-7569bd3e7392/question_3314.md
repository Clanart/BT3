# Q3314: NewEVMSigPreVerifier - Bad Chain Id Tx Bypasses Early Rejection And Reaches Locked Path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit, replace, reorder, or batch pending transactions through `raw transaction submitted to app mempool preverification` while controlling `raw tx bytes` and `signer extraction`, under the precondition that the same tx can reach preverification and locked admission, drive `broadcastTx fallback -> CometBFT BroadcastTx -> FinalizeBlock ante` in `appmempool/preverify.go::NewEVMSigPreVerifier` so that bad-chain-ID tx bypasses early rejection and reaches locked path, violating the invariant that fallback broadcast must not bypass signature or fee checks, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `appmempool/preverify.go::NewEVMSigPreVerifier`
- Entrypoint: `raw transaction submitted to app mempool preverification`
- Attacker controls: `raw tx bytes`, `signer extraction`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: bad-chain-ID tx bypasses early rejection and reaches locked path through `broadcastTx fallback -> CometBFT BroadcastTx -> FinalizeBlock ante`.
- Invariant to test: fallback broadcast must not bypass signature or fee checks.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: build a two-message Cosmos tx fixture and assert ante, execution, refund, and receipt invariants after FinalizeBlock.
