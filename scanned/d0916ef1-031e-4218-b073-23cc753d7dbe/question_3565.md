# Q3565: Drive state split inside total_work_and_watchtower_flags_setup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation with crafted multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context so `total_work_and_watchtower_flags_setup` updates one canonical value while another subsystem retains the older one for the same event, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and breaking the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/mod.rs::total_work_and_watchtower_flags_setup
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: update one canonical value while another subsystem keeps the old one for the same event via multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
