# Q1157: WombatPoolHelperV2.deposit - depositFor hardcodes _minimumLiquidity to zero

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol: depositFor() calls _deposit(_amount, 0, _for, address(this)) with the Wombat minimum liquidity pinned to zero, so a deposit routed through it accepts any execution the pool gives, and the receipt mint is taken from whatever delta results. With _amount and _minimumLiquidity under attacker control and the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, can an unprivileged caller sequence `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` so that `this.balance(msg.sender)` and `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a deposit path must carry a slippage floor even when the beneficiary is not the caller and realising Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: depositFor hardcodes _minimumLiquidity to zero)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: depositFor() calls _deposit(_amount, 0, _for, address(this)) with the Wombat minimum liquidity pinned to zero, so a deposit routed through it accepts any execution the pool gives, and the receipt mint is taken from whatever delta results. Precondition: the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested.
- Invariant to test: a deposit path must carry a slippage floor even when the beneficiary is not the caller; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, call `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, and assert `this.balance(msg.sender)` equals `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
