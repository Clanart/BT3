# Q4865: merge-price via liquidate: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `min-collateral-expected`, drive `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) — which attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id — to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-collateral-expected`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
