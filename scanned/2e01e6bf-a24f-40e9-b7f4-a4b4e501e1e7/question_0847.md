# Q0847: relevant via collateral-remove-redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
`relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `min-underlying`, use that to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with `min-underlying`, then read `relevant` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
