# Q5130: accrue-user-collateral via redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `accrue-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
