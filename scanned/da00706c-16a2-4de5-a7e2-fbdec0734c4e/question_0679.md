# Q0679: iter-lookup-collateral via collateral-remove: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
`iter-lookup-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180) skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), use that to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:180` -> `iter-lookup-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-collateral` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's collateral vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), then read `iter-lookup-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
