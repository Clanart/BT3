# Q438: Replay context into fetch_and_save_missing_blocks

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with attacker-controlled the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering so `fetch_and_save_missing_blocks` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the reimbursement path that must remain slashable and recoverable to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/header_chain_prover.rs::fetch_and_save_missing_blocks
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
