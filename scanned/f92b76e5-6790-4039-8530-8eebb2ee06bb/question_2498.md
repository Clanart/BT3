# Q2498: create_account size-accounting drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `create_account` by submit transactions that rapidly create, fund, close, and recreate accounts with rapid create-close-recreate cycles and near-boundary account sizes so that byte counters or cache-size accounting can undercount real resident or persisted account state, breaking the invariant that cache and storage size accounting must track actual resident state accurately and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::create_account
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that rapidly create, fund, close, and recreate accounts
- Attacker controls: rapid create-close-recreate cycles and near-boundary account sizes
- Exploit idea: use large-account churn to separate logical counts from physical bytes
- Invariant to test: cache and storage size accounting must track actual resident state accurately
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: measure counter growth against real resident bytes
