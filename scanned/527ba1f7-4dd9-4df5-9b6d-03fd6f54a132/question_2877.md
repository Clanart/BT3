# Q2877: debt-remove-scaled via liquidate: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, drive `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) — which clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `liquidate` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `debt-remove-scaled` touches, run `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
