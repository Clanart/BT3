# Q5689: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Does `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, so that `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` diverges from `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`, the invariant that the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal is broken, and the result is Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Precondition: MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed.
- Invariant to test: the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, snapshot `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`, run the attacker's `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
