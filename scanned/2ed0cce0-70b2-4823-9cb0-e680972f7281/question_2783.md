# Q2783: accounts_cache.add_root read-only cache incoherence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `add_root` by submit transactions that touch many accounts near root advancement with many-account writes near root advancement so that read-only caching can return a version that writable/runtime paths would reject as stale, breaking the invariant that read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::add_root
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that touch many accounts near root advancement
- Attacker controls: many-account writes near root advancement
- Exploit idea: diff read-only and runtime-visible answers for the same account
- Invariant to test: read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare read-only cache results to direct runtime/bank reads after writes
