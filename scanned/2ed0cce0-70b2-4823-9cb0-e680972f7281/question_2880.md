# Q2880: notify_gossip_subscribers many-pubkey memory balloon

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_gossip_subscribers` by trigger in-scope subscriptions and then submit transactions that generate hot notifications with subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams so that one user can create enough cache/index state through attacker-owned accounts to exhaust memory faster than cleanup responds, breaking the invariant that attacker-owned account fanout must not create unbounded cache or index growth and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_gossip_subscribers
- Entrypoint: trigger in-scope subscriptions and then submit transactions that generate hot notifications
- Attacker controls: subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams
- Exploit idea: use many small valid accounts as the amplifier
- Invariant to test: attacker-owned account fanout must not create unbounded cache or index growth
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: create many valid attacker-controlled accounts and track cache/index growth
