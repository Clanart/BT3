# Q2673: Accept wrong proof/network context in calculate_feerate_sat_per_kvb

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering through user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync so `calculate_feerate_sat_per_kvb` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the linkage between Citrea state and a replacement deposit move transaction and breaking the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/tests.rs::calculate_feerate_sat_per_kvb
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
