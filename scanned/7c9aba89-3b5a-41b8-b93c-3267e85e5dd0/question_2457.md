# Q2457: NEAR bind_token refund refund goes to wrong logical owner at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `refund callback after public `bind_token`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering minimal deposits, maximal storage payloads, and withdrawal edges and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token_refund` violate `refund logic must never let an attacker keep a successful binding while reclaiming the full deposit, or lose funds on a successful bind due to callback ordering` in the `refund goes to wrong logical owner` attack class because refunds either the explicit callback amount or the whole attached deposit after token-binding attempts becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token_refund`
- Entrypoint: `refund callback after public `bind_token``
- Attacker controls: callback success or failure, predecessor account chosen for refund, and attached deposit
- Exploit idea: Target asynchronous state removal, carried predecessor identities, and stored owner fields. Concentrate on minimal deposits, maximal storage payloads, and withdrawal edges.
- Invariant to test: refund logic must never let an attacker keep a successful binding while reclaiming the full deposit, or lose funds on a successful bind due to callback ordering
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Trace refund ownership across success and failure branches and assert that only the original funder can recover the reserved storage. Sweep boundary values for minimal deposits, maximal storage payloads, and withdrawal edges and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
