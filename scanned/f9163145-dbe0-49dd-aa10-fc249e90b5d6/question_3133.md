# Q3133: filter_account_result read-only cache incoherence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_account_result` by use in-scope account subscriptions and hot account churn with account subscription filters, encodings, and hot account streams so that read-only caching can return a version that writable/runtime paths would reject as stale, breaking the invariant that read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_account_result
- Entrypoint: use in-scope account subscriptions and hot account churn
- Attacker controls: account subscription filters, encodings, and hot account streams
- Exploit idea: diff read-only and runtime-visible answers for the same account
- Invariant to test: read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare read-only cache results to direct runtime/bank reads after writes
