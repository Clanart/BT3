# Q2114: hmac_valid?: A body whose raw bytes differ from the parsed params so the sig...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the raw request body, the X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header) reach `hmac_valid? / shopify_hmac` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/payload_verification.rb via POST /webhooks/:type (WebhooksController) and the extension verification controller, supplying a body whose raw bytes differ from the parsed params so the signed bytes and processed data disagree, so that only a body HMAC'd with the app's real secret may be accepted, over the exact signed bytes is violated, leading to forged webhook accepted -> unauthorized state change / spoofed shop data? Specifically confirm that concurrent execution produces exactly one consistent session/token with no cross-tenant leakage.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/payload_verification.rb — `hmac_valid? / shopify_hmac`
- Entrypoint: POST /webhooks/:type (WebhooksController) and the extension verification controller
- Attacker controls: the raw request body, the X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header — specifically a body whose raw bytes differ from the parsed params so the signed bytes and processed data disagree.
- Exploit idea: Fire the flow twice in parallel to expose non-atomic checks or double-writes.
- Invariant to test: only a body HMAC'd with the app's real secret may be accepted, over the exact signed bytes
- Expected Immunefi impact: forged webhook accepted -> unauthorized state change / spoofed shop data (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: concurrency test running the flow on N threads and asserting exactly one row/token and no cross-tenant write.
