# Q1246: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.depositLP - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. With _lpAmount under attacker control and the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, can an unprivileged caller sequence `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` so that `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard and realising Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` sequence atomically under the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, asserting at the end that `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` still equals `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
