# Q1340: HookedStateDB.SetCode - Trace Predecessor Replay Installs Delegation Into Target State

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker request debug_trace* for crafted included transactions or calls through `debug/trace hooked EIP-7702 or CREATE code mutation` while controlling `traceReplay` and `predecessor tx list`, under the precondition that the traced transaction has predecessors in the same block, drive `TraceCall/TraceBlock -> block context setup -> hooked StateDB execution` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb_hooked.go::HookedStateDB.SetCode` so that trace predecessor replay installs delegation into target state, violating the invariant that traceReplay must not mask balance/fee invariants, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb_hooked.go::HookedStateDB.SetCode`
- Entrypoint: `debug/trace hooked EIP-7702 or CREATE code mutation`
- Attacker controls: `traceReplay`, `predecessor tx list`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: trace predecessor replay installs delegation into target state through `TraceCall/TraceBlock -> block context setup -> hooked StateDB execution`.
- Invariant to test: traceReplay must not mask balance/fee invariants.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: add a fuzz case varying the attacker-controlled fields and differential-check against go-ethereum for tx validity, gas, nonce, and code/storage effects.
