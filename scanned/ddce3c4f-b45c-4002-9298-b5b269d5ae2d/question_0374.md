# Q0374: resolve-dia via liquidate-redeem: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the redemption receiver varied, and assert that the value `resolve-dia` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
