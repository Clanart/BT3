# Q3966: Starknet transfer payload Borsh encoding same fee collectible twice via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `fin_transfer` signature path` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `starknet/src/bridge_types.cairo::TransferMessagePayloadTrait and related encoding` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `same fee collectible twice` under encodes Starknet transfer payload fields into Borsh bytes that are Keccak-hashed for signature verification, violating `payload encoding must stay in lockstep with Near and EVM so Starknet signatures cannot authorize a different transfer off-chain than on-chain`?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/bridge_types.cairo::TransferMessagePayloadTrait and related encoding`
- Entrypoint: `public `fin_transfer` signature path`
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, origin chain, origin nonce, token address, amount, recipient, fee recipient, and message
- Exploit idea: Target pending-transfer cleanup, fast-transfer removal, and replay protection around fee-claim proofs. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: payload encoding must stay in lockstep with Near and EVM so Starknet signatures cannot authorize a different transfer off-chain than on-chain
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Claim once, then replay or mutate non-economic proof fields and assert that no second claim succeeds or blocks unrelated transfers. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
