# Q3277: vault-accrue via liquidate-redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the borrower targeted, drive `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) — which dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id — to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, then read `vault-accrue` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
