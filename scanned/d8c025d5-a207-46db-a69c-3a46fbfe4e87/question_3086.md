# Q3086: EVM OmniBridge initTransfer resume-path replay or duplication at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public EVM outbound transfer entrypoint` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::initTransfer` violate `one outbound transfer must consume exactly the assets represented by the emitted bridge event and must not let branch-specific accounting diverge from the signed or relayed payload` in the `resume-path replay or duplication` attack class because increments `currentOriginNonce`, enforces `fee < amount`, collects or burns assets depending on native/custom/bridge-token branches, and forwards value to `initTransferExtension` becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::initTransfer`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM outbound transfer entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: token address, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, message bytes, and msg.value
- Exploit idea: Abuse yield/resume or asynchronous callback timing so the same pending outbound transfer is restarted after it already progressed. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: one outbound transfer must consume exactly the assets represented by the emitted bridge event and must not let branch-specific accounting diverge from the signed or relayed payload
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trigger timeouts, duplicate funding, and repeated callback delivery and assert that the resumed transfer either progresses once or cleanly fails once. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
