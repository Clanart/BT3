# Q3886: NEAR Wormhole byte_utils one verified event can be reinterpreted as another via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `get_u8/get_u16/get_u32/get_u64/get_bytes32 via public Wormhole proof parsing` and then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint so that `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/byte_utils.rs::ByteUtils` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `one verified event can be reinterpreted as another` under provides raw big-endian byte reads that the VAA parser uses to interpret structured fields from untrusted bytes, violating `every field extraction must reject or safely fail on malformed lengths so offset tricks cannot reinterpret one field as another`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/byte_utils.rs::ByteUtils`
- Entrypoint: `get_u8/get_u16/get_u32/get_u64/get_bytes32 via public Wormhole proof parsing`
- Attacker controls: raw VAA bytes and the exact offsets consumed by the parser
- Exploit idea: Target shared envelopes and topic/payload parsers for init, finalize, deploy, and metadata events. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: every field extraction must reject or safely fail on malformed lengths so offset tricks cannot reinterpret one field as another
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Attempt to parse the same verified bytes under every event class and assert that only one parser accepts them. Then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
