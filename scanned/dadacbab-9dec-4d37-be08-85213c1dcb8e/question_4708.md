# Q4708: linear-interpolate via accrue: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the utilization the rate is interpolated at reach `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `accrue` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
