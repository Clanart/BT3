# Q2125: calculate-asset-notional-value via supply-collateral-add: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), drive `calculate-asset-notional-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544) — which normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544` -> `calculate-asset-notional-value`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `calculate-asset-notional-value` normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), then read `calculate-asset-notional-value` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
