# Q1380: mWOM.incentiveDeposit - mWOM minted on the requested amount rather than on veWOM actually obtained

## Question
In wombat/mWOM.sol, _convert() mints exactly _amount of mWOM and then _lockWom() adds only the returned mintedVeWomAmount to totalAccumulated, so a veWOM mint that returns less than expected leaves mWOM supply ahead of real backing. Starting from a state where rewardRatio is configured above DENOMINATOR so the bonus exceeds the deposit, can an unprivileged EOA use `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, bool _stake)` to leave `vlMGPAmount = _amount * rewardRatio / DENOMINATOR` inconsistent with `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(address(this))`, violating the invariant that wrapper supply must never exceed the backing actually secured for it and extracting Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWOM.sol -> `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, bool _stake)` (mechanism: mWOM minted on the requested amount rather than on veWOM actually obtained)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, bool _stake)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount with no cap, and _stake, while rewardRatio is non-zero
- Exploit idea: _convert() mints exactly _amount of mWOM and then _lockWom() adds only the returned mintedVeWomAmount to totalAccumulated, so a veWOM mint that returns less than expected leaves mWOM supply ahead of real backing. Precondition: rewardRatio is configured above DENOMINATOR so the bonus exceeds the deposit.
- Invariant to test: wrapper supply must never exceed the backing actually secured for it; concretely, `vlMGPAmount = _amount * rewardRatio / DENOMINATOR` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount with no cap, and _stake, while rewardRatio is non-zero) under rewardRatio is configured above DENOMINATOR so the bonus exceeds the deposit, asserting on every row that wrapper supply must never exceed the backing actually secured for it.
