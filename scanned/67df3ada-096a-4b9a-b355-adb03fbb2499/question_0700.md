# Q700: Exploit reorg boundary handling in verify_storage_proofs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit reorg timing around the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof so `verify_storage_proofs` treats a non-canonical object as canonical long enough to mutate bridge state, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/storage_proof.rs::verify_storage_proofs
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Exploit idea: reorder or replay the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof across canonical and non-canonical views
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
