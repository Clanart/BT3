# Q1351: NEAR claim_fee callback asset-branch confusion on finalization

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `proof callback reached from public `claim_fee`` to make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee_callback` release value through a more favorable branch than the source event actually authorized because of removes the stored transfer, enforces fee-recipient equality, reconciles fast-transfer state, denormalizes the amount from the destination event, computes fee including any documented dust, and sends the fee, violating `claiming fees must never let a caller delete the pending record, collect twice, or collect against a destination event that does not match the stored origin transfer`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee_callback`
- Entrypoint: `proof callback reached from public `claim_fee``
- Attacker controls: decoded `FinTransfer` result, predecessor account, pending transfer record, origin transfer id for fast paths, and token decimals
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches.
- Invariant to test: claiming fees must never let a caller delete the pending record, collect twice, or collect against a destination event that does not match the stored origin transfer
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state.
