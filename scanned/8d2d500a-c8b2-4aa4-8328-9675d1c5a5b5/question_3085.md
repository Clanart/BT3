# Q3085: EVM OmniBridge finTransfer delivery callback leaves inconsistent state at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public EVM settlement entrypoint` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::finTransfer` violate `one signed settlement payload must release value exactly once to the intended token branch and recipient without letting state updates, branch selection, or message handling fork the outcome` in the `delivery callback leaves inconsistent state` attack class because marks `completedTransfers[destinationNonce] = true`, hashes a Borsh-encoded transfer payload, validates the signature, then releases ETH, transfers ERC-1155, calls a custom minter, mints a bridge token, or transfers an ERC-20 becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::finTransfer`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM settlement entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: signature bytes, destination nonce, origin chain, origin nonce, token address, amount, recipient, fee recipient, and message bytes
- Exploit idea: Focus on `ft_transfer_call`, unwrap callbacks, and post-delivery resolution that decide whether to burn, refund, or remove records. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: one signed settlement payload must release value exactly once to the intended token branch and recipient without letting state updates, branch selection, or message handling fork the outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Enumerate callback results and assert that each result maps to exactly one consistent combination of delivered value, replay state, and storage refund. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
