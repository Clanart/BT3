# Q3100: Solana finalize_transfer_sol shared proof response reused across entrypoints at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Solana `finalize_transfer_sol` instruction` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::finalize_transfer_sol` violate `native-SOL settlement must not be replayable or capable of releasing value under the wrong domain, amount, or recipient binding` in the `shared proof response reused across entrypoints` attack class because verifies the NEAR-derived signature for a SOL transfer, uses nonce tracking, and processes native-SOL finalization becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::finalize_transfer_sol`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `finalize_transfer_sol` instruction`
- Attacker controls: signed payload bytes, destination nonce, recipient account, payer funding, and SOL-specific account layout
- Exploit idea: Attack systems where one verifier contract serves deploy, finalize, metadata, and fee-claim flows with a shared result type. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: native-SOL settlement must not be replayable or capable of releasing value under the wrong domain, amount, or recipient binding
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Attempt to route accepted verifier outputs into every public proof consumer and assert that each entrypoint only accepts its intended result variant and source semantics. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
