# Q1285: NEAR foreign/native token mapping lookup canonical token identity collision at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public multi-hop settlement flows that map tokens across chains` with boundary-controlled inputs covering zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::get_bridged_token` violate `multi-chain mapping lookup must never return a different asset than the one collateral actually backs, especially in foreign-to-foreign forwarding` in the `canonical token identity collision` attack class because resolves a token across Near and foreign chains using token-id and address maps that span multiple bridge adapters becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::get_bridged_token`
- Entrypoint: `public multi-hop settlement flows that map tokens across chains`
- Attacker controls: source address, target chain, and any mapping state created by deploy/bind flows
- Exploit idea: Target hashed token ids, deterministic synthetic addresses, PDA seeds, and address-to-token maps. Concentrate on zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values.
- Invariant to test: multi-chain mapping lookup must never return a different asset than the one collateral actually backs, especially in foreign-to-foreign forwarding
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Search for collisions and alias conditions and assert that two distinct remote assets cannot share one local token identity or mapping row. Sweep boundary values for zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
