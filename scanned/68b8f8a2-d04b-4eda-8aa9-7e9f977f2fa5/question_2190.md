# Q2190: handle_forwarded_packets fee-payer unlock split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `handle_forwarded_packets` by submit transactions that legitimately enter the forwarding path with payload sizes, duplicate packets, versioned messages, and boundary forwarding timing such that fee-payer lock or unlock handling may diverge from the accounts actually charged later, breaking the invariant that fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/fetch_stage.rs::handle_forwarded_packets
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that legitimately enter the forwarding path
- Attacker controls: payload sizes, duplicate packets, versioned messages, and boundary forwarding timing
- Exploit idea: try to free or relock the fee payer at the wrong moment
- Invariant to test: fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace fee-payer lock state across retries, conflicts, and partial failures
