# Q1346: BaseRewardPool.getReward - _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles

## Question
In rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol, _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Does `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under rewards[token].queuedRewards holds a large backlog accumulated while totalStaked() was zero, so that `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` diverges from `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`, the invariant that a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered is broken, and the result is High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the timing of the claim, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Precondition: rewards[token].queuedRewards holds a large backlog accumulated while totalStaked() was zero.
- Invariant to test: a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` sequence atomically under rewards[token].queuedRewards holds a large backlog accumulated while totalStaked() was zero, asserting at the end that `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` still equals `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
