# Q1957: unpack-u16 via call-ststx-ratio: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, drive `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) — which unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `call-ststx-ratio` with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, then read `unpack-u16` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
