# Q1137: update_access_scopes?: A `shop` param pointing to a session whose scope matches config...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `shop` domain param selecting the stored session to compare) reach `update_access_scopes?` in lib/shopify_app/access_scopes/shop_strategy.rb via legacy scope-change reauth (ShopAccessScopesVerification), supplying a `shop` param pointing to a session whose scope matches config, suppressing a needed re-auth for the real shop, so that scope-change detection must key on the verified shop, not an arbitrary param is violated, leading to scope reauthorization bypass? Specifically confirm that the activated session binds to the verified token's shop/user, never a disagreeing cookie/param.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/access_scopes/shop_strategy.rb — `update_access_scopes?`
- Entrypoint: legacy scope-change reauth (ShopAccessScopesVerification)
- Attacker controls: the `shop` domain param selecting the stored session to compare — specifically a `shop` param pointing to a session whose scope matches config, suppressing a needed re-auth for the real shop.
- Exploit idea: Present a cookie and a token that disagree on shop/user and confirm the verified token wins, not the cookie.
- Invariant to test: scope-change detection must key on the verified shop, not an arbitrary param
- Expected Immunefi impact: scope reauthorization bypass (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: test with a mismatched cookie/token pair asserting the session binds to the verified token's shop/user only.
