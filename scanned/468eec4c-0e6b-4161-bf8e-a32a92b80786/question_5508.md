# Q5508: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.harvest - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, is there an unprivileged sequence of `harvest()` that leaves `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` unreconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`, violates the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding, and delivers High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the harvest timing for the whole pool
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `harvest()`: constrain the setup so that the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, fuzz the attacker inputs (the harvest timing for the whole pool), and assert after every call that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding.
