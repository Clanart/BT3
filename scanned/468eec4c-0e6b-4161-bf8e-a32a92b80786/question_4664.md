# Q4664: BaseRewardPool.getReward - _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles

## Question
In rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol, _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Starting from a state where the reward token charges a transfer fee so the received balance is below the requested amount, can an unprivileged EOA use `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` to leave `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` inconsistent with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`, violating the invariant that a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered and extracting High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the timing of the claim, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Precondition: the reward token charges a transfer fee so the received balance is below the requested amount.
- Invariant to test: a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the reward token charges a transfer fee so the received balance is below the requested amount, have the attacker run `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` versus `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
