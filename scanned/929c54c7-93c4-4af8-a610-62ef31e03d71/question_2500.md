# Q2500: EVM BridgeToken burn custody accounting diverges from wrapped supply at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public outbound-side burn reachable only through bridge-owner calls` with boundary-controlled inputs covering zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/BridgeToken.sol::burn` violate `wrapped-token burns must always stay synchronized with emitted bridge events so users cannot redeem, migrate, or replay burned value twice` in the `custody accounting diverges from wrapped supply` attack class because owner-only burn is the bridge’s canonical way to destroy wrapped supply before emitting outbound claims becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/BridgeToken.sol::burn`
- Entrypoint: `public outbound-side burn reachable only through bridge-owner calls`
- Attacker controls: account and amount chosen by the bridge
- Exploit idea: Target branches that mint, burn, lock, unlock, transfer vault assets, or unwrap native value. Concentrate on zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values.
- Invariant to test: wrapped-token burns must always stay synchronized with emitted bridge events so users cannot redeem, migrate, or replay burned value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Build a per-asset conservation model and assert that total claims never exceed total backing after every public flow. Sweep boundary values for zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
