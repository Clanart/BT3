# Q3859: NEAR deploy_token callback fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `proof callback for public `deploy_token`` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token_callback` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical` under checks the emitting factory, then calls `deploy_token_internal` using metadata from the validated message, violating `proof-bound metadata must not be replayable or malleable in a way that deploys the wrong token id, wrong decimals, or conflicting mappings`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token_callback`
- Entrypoint: `proof callback for public `deploy_token``
- Attacker controls: decoded `LogMetadata` result, chain kind, token address, metadata contents, and attached deposit
- Exploit idea: Target checks that only inspect mint authority, owner, or one mapping row without proving the full asset identity. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: proof-bound metadata must not be replayable or malleable in a way that deploys the wrong token id, wrong decimals, or conflicting mappings
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Construct plausible fake bridge-controlled assets and assert that deployment, settlement, and forwarding reject them unless they are the canonical mapping for that remote asset. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
