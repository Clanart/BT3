# Q2576: Solana signed-payload serialization one inbound event spawns multiple outbound obligations at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Solana deploy/init/finalize instructions` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/* plus instruction callers` violate `serialized payloads must match Near’s decoding byte-for-byte so one Solana event cannot be verified as a different Near-side bridge action` in the `one inbound event spawns multiple outbound obligations` attack class because serializes deploy, init, and finalize payloads into the bytes that Near later verifies and interprets becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/* plus instruction callers`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana deploy/init/finalize instructions`
- Attacker controls: all payload fields that are serialized for Near and signed by the derived bridge key
- Exploit idea: Focus on forward-to-other-chain branches and fast-transfer substitution where an inbound event becomes a new pending transfer. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: serialized payloads must match Near’s decoding byte-for-byte so one Solana event cannot be verified as a different Near-side bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Track value and replay state across both the inbound leg and the forwarded leg and assert that one source event cannot increase total outstanding claims. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
