# Q2314: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getRewards - totalStaked and balanceOf drawn from unrelated sources

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, totalStaked() reads IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply() while balanceOf() reads MasterMagpie's UserInfo.amount for the same account, so the numerator and the denominator of every reward computation come from two independently maintained ledgers. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` while the computed forfeit lands just above the _amount / 1000 dust threshold, and drive `forfeitAmount` out of agreement with `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored` - breaking the invariant that sum of balanceOf over all accounts must equal totalStaked at all times - for Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: totalStaked and balanceOf drawn from unrelated sources)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: totalStaked() reads IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply() while balanceOf() reads MasterMagpie's UserInfo.amount for the same account, so the numerator and the denominator of every reward computation come from two independently maintained ledgers. Precondition: the computed forfeit lands just above the _amount / 1000 dust threshold.
- Invariant to test: sum of balanceOf over all accounts must equal totalStaked at all times; concretely, `forfeitAmount` must stay reconciled with `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the computed forfeit lands just above the _amount / 1000 dust threshold, have the attacker run `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `forfeitAmount` versus `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
