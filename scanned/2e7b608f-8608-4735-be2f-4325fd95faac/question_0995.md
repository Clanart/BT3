# Q995: HookedStateDB.AddBalance - Tracer Mutation Affects Final Committed Logs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker request debug_trace* for crafted included transactions or calls through `debug/trace hooked EVM execution balance credit` while controlling `predecessor tx list` and `hooked StateDB`, under the precondition that traceReplay or state overrides are enabled, drive `TraceTransaction -> indexer lookup -> predecessor reconstruction -> TraceTx` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb_hooked.go::HookedStateDB.AddBalance` so that tracer mutation affects final committed logs, violating the invariant that predecessor replay must reconstruct the exact block state, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb_hooked.go::HookedStateDB.AddBalance`
- Entrypoint: `debug/trace hooked EVM execution balance credit`
- Attacker controls: `predecessor tx list`, `hooked StateDB`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: tracer mutation affects final committed logs through `TraceTransaction -> indexer lookup -> predecessor reconstruction -> TraceTx`.
- Invariant to test: predecessor replay must reconstruct the exact block state.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: replay the same scenario through eth_call or estimateGas and through eth_sendRawTransaction and assert the only difference is persistence.
