# Q2879: Solana init response serialization same fee collectible twice via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public init instructions through `InitTransfer::process` and `InitTransferSol::process`` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/init_transfer.rs` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `same fee collectible twice` under serializes outbound transfer payloads that Near-side verifiers later accept as source-chain events, violating `payload bytes must not let one Solana transfer be verified as another due to optional-string, nonce, or mint-field ambiguity`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/init_transfer.rs`
- Entrypoint: `public init instructions through `InitTransfer::process` and `InitTransferSol::process``
- Attacker controls: sender, mint, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, sequence, and origin nonce source
- Exploit idea: Target pending-transfer cleanup, fast-transfer removal, and replay protection around fee-claim proofs. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: payload bytes must not let one Solana transfer be verified as another due to optional-string, nonce, or mint-field ambiguity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Claim once, then replay or mutate non-economic proof fields and assert that no second claim succeeds or blocks unrelated transfers. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
