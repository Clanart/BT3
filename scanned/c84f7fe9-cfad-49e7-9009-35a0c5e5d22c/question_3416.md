# Q3416: Solana metadata-seed derivation ABI version switch changes metadata identity via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `deploy_token`` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/deploy_token.rs metadata PDA creation` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `ABI version switch changes metadata identity` under creates metadata for a newly deployed wrapped mint using a hashed-or-padded token string as the core remote identity, violating `seed derivation must not let long token ids, collisions, or PDA reuse create a second remote asset that aliases an existing mint or metadata account`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/deploy_token.rs metadata PDA creation`
- Entrypoint: `public `deploy_token``
- Attacker controls: mint PDA, metadata PDA seeds, payer funding, and extremely long token strings that get hashed before seed use
- Exploit idea: Target old-style versus new-style token metadata return shapes and zero-length special cases. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: seed derivation must not let long token ids, collisions, or PDA reuse create a second remote asset that aliases an existing mint or metadata account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Return ambiguous ABI payloads and assert that the bridge either rejects them or derives the exact intended metadata once. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
