# Q0822: WombatBribeManager.voteAndCast - getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown

## Question
wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol: getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. With the deltas and the atomic vote-then-cast ordering inside one transaction under attacker control and a large bribe has just landed in the Wombat bribe contract and no cast has happened yet, can an unprivileged caller sequence `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)` so that `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]` and `IBribeRewardPool(pool.rewarder).balanceOf(user)` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance and realising Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)` (mechanism: getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the deltas and the atomic vote-then-cast ordering inside one transaction
- Exploit idea: getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Precondition: a large bribe has just landed in the Wombat bribe contract and no cast has happened yet.
- Invariant to test: the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance; concretely, `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]` must stay reconciled with `IBribeRewardPool(pool.rewarder).balanceOf(user)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)` sequence atomically under a large bribe has just landed in the Wombat bribe contract and no cast has happened yet, asserting at the end that `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]` still equals `IBribeRewardPool(pool.rewarder).balanceOf(user)` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
