# Q3548: WombatPoolHelperV2.withdraw - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, where none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Assuming a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` via `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`, breaking the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard and producing Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity and _minAmount
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_liquidity and _minAmount) under a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, asserting on every row that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard.
