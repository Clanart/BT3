# Q2890: Decouple emergency protection in generate_challenge_ack_preimages_and_hashes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker push attacker-controlled the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering through public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `generate_challenge_ack_preimages_and_hashes` advances the main settlement path while the emergency-stop or recovery path remains tied to a different context, corrupting the nofn aggregate key and covenant context and breaking the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/operator.rs::generate_challenge_ack_preimages_and_hashes
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering
- Exploit idea: advance the main path while protection/recovery remains tied to another context
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
