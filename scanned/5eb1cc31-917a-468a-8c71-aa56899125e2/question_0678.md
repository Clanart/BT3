# Q0678: zip via liquidate-redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the redemption receiver across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `zip` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
