# Q0668: add-user-scaled-debt via liquidate: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `debt-amount` reach `add-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237` -> `add-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `debt-amount` varied, and assert that the value `add-user-scaled-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
