# Q5573: WombatPoolHelperV2.harvest - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol - none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling the harvest timing for the whole pool, under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, exploit this through `harvest()` to break the reconciliation between `this.balance(msg.sender)` and `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` and the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard, yielding Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the harvest timing for the whole pool
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, snapshot `this.balance(msg.sender)` and `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`, run the attacker's `harvest()` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
