# Q1370: load_program reserved-key bypass

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_program` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with program deployment/upgrade timing, cpi invocation patterns, and versioned message layouts such that duplicated accounts or versioned message features let attacker-controlled keys slip past reserved-key assumptions, breaking the invariant that reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::load_program
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: program deployment/upgrade timing, CPI invocation patterns, and versioned message layouts
- Exploit idea: search for paths where reserved-key checks see a different key set than execution
- Invariant to test: reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: construct versioned transactions whose ALT-expanded account set changes the effective key view
