# Q1992: prune_by_deployment_slot serialization aliasing

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `prune_by_deployment_slot` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs around upgrade/close churn with upgrade timing, close/reopen timing, and repeated invocation of the same program id such that account memory serialization or deserialization can alias overlapping regions and write back inconsistent data, breaking the invariant that one logical account backing store must not be interpreted as two independent writable regions and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/loaded_programs.rs::prune_by_deployment_slot
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs around upgrade/close churn
- Attacker controls: upgrade timing, close/reopen timing, and repeated invocation of the same program id
- Exploit idea: target duplicate accounts, reallocs, and nested CPIs that touch the same backing data twice
- Invariant to test: one logical account backing store must not be interpreted as two independent writable regions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace serialized and deserialized memory regions for duplicated writable accounts
