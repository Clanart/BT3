# Q2629: read_only_accounts_cache.load remove-unrooted state loss

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that repeatedly fetch recently changed accounts with rapid read-after-write patterns against the same accounts so that state the runtime or RPC still needs can be removed because slot liveness assumptions are too aggressive, breaking the invariant that only truly unreachable unrooted state should be removed and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs::load
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that repeatedly fetch recently changed accounts
- Attacker controls: rapid read-after-write patterns against the same accounts
- Exploit idea: look for premature removal under churn
- Invariant to test: only truly unreachable unrooted state should be removed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: drive fast fork/root churn with attacker-owned accounts and verify consistency afterward
