# Q2281: process_transactions account-size meter wrap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_transactions` by use json-rpc `sendtransaction` from one low-rate client with serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, duplicate-signature timing, and queue pressure such that account-size or memory-region arithmetic may wrap, saturate, or truncate on attacker-chosen boundaries, breaking the invariant that size meters and offsets must match true account memory bounds and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs::process_transactions
- Entrypoint: use JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from one low-rate client
- Attacker controls: serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, duplicate-signature timing, and queue pressure
- Exploit idea: search for silent integer boundary behavior in size/accounting code
- Invariant to test: size meters and offsets must match true account memory bounds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: hit the largest legal account sizes and offset combinations
