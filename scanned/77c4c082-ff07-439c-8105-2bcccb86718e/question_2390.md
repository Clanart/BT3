# Q2390: clean_accounts hot-stream starvation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `clean_accounts` by submit transactions that create, drain, resize, and recreate many accounts with high-churn account creation/close patterns and repeated zero-lamport transitions so that one hot account/program/signature stream monopolizes work and starves other subscribers, breaking the invariant that one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::clean_accounts
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that create, drain, resize, and recreate many accounts
- Attacker controls: high-churn account creation/close patterns and repeated zero-lamport transitions
- Exploit idea: measure cross-subscriber fairness
- Invariant to test: one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: pair a hot stream with a cheap control subscription
