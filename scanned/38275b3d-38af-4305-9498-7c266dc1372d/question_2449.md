# Q2449: to clvm mis-bind attacker-controlled bytes to trusted state via improper list terminators

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker derive typed values from CLVM nodes targeting `to_clvm` in `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs` with improper list terminators when duplicate or prefix-colliding items are present make chia_rs mis-bind attacker-controlled bytes to trusted state, violating the invariant that list terminators cannot change parsed conditions, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: High. Signature, aggregate signature, synthetic key, puzzle type, condition, timelock, or coin-id validation bypass enables unauthorized spend acceptance or replay?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs:201` / `to_clvm`
- Entrypoint: derive typed values from CLVM nodes
- Attacker controls: improper list terminators
- Exploit idea: Drive `to_clvm` through its public caller path using improper list terminators; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: list terminators cannot change parsed conditions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Signature, aggregate signature, synthetic key, puzzle type, condition, timelock, or coin-id validation bypass enables unauthorized spend acceptance or replay
- Fast validation: differential-test curried tree hash against executing the curried program.
