# Q2973: notify_vote size-accounting drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_vote` by subscribe to votes and then drive hot transaction flow that affects vote visibility with vote subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot notification streams so that byte counters or cache-size accounting can undercount real resident or persisted account state, breaking the invariant that cache and storage size accounting must track actual resident state accurately and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_vote
- Entrypoint: subscribe to votes and then drive hot transaction flow that affects vote visibility
- Attacker controls: vote subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot notification streams
- Exploit idea: use large-account churn to separate logical counts from physical bytes
- Invariant to test: cache and storage size accounting must track actual resident state accurately
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: measure counter growth against real resident bytes
