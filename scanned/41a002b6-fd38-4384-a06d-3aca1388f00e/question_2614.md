# Q2614: Duplicate queue or processing state in calculate_groth16_public_input

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `calculate_groth16_public_input` twice with attacker-controlled reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove context treated as canonical for a deposit and violating the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/structs.rs::calculate_groth16_public_input
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
