# Q1058: process_transaction compute undercharge

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_transaction` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with instruction order, duplicated accounts, nonce/blockhash choices, and fee / compute settings such that attacker-chosen instruction graphs consume materially more compute than the path here appears to meter, breaking the invariant that runtime work must be fully covered by compute metering before commit and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::process_transaction
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: instruction order, duplicated accounts, nonce/blockhash choices, and fee / compute settings
- Exploit idea: look for work that escapes the intended compute meter or is charged too late
- Invariant to test: runtime work must be fully covered by compute metering before commit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: instrument compute-meter consumption around CPI-heavy or log-heavy transactions
