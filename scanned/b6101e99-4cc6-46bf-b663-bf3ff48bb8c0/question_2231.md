# Q2231: retry_thread CPI signer confusion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `retry_thread` by use json-rpc `sendtransaction` from one low-rate client with serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and duplicate-signature timing such that nested invocation state lets attacker-controlled signer or writable flags be translated inconsistently, breaking the invariant that cpi must preserve signer and writable semantics exactly and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs::retry_thread
- Entrypoint: use JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from one low-rate client
- Attacker controls: serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and duplicate-signature timing
- Exploit idea: look for ways to gain authority or write access through CPI translation mismatches
- Invariant to test: CPI must preserve signer and writable semantics exactly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: build nested CPI graphs with repeated accounts and diff signer/writable sets at each level
