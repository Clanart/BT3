# Q908: EVM BridgeToken burn native versus wrapped branch switch via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public outbound-side burn reachable only through bridge-owner calls` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/BridgeToken.sol::burn` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `native versus wrapped branch switch` under owner-only burn is the bridge’s canonical way to destroy wrapped supply before emitting outbound claims, violating `wrapped-token burns must always stay synchronized with emitted bridge events so users cannot redeem, migrate, or replay burned value twice`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/BridgeToken.sol::burn`
- Entrypoint: `public outbound-side burn reachable only through bridge-owner calls`
- Attacker controls: account and amount chosen by the bridge
- Exploit idea: Target zero-address, deployed-token, custom-minter, native-vault, or bridge-token branch predicates. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: wrapped-token burns must always stay synchronized with emitted bridge events so users cannot redeem, migrate, or replay burned value twice
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each branch predicate to flip around callbacks or mapping writes and assert that the same source asset can never produce two incompatible custody models. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
