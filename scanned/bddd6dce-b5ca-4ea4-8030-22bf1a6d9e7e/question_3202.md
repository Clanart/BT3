# Q3202: NEAR send_tokens helper asset-branch confusion on finalization

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `internal helper reached from public finalize and fast paths` to make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens` release value through a more favorable branch than the source event actually authorized because of chooses between wNEAR unwrap, bridge-token mint, `ft_transfer`, and `ft_transfer_call` depending on token type and message presence, violating `asset-delivery helper logic must not let attacker-controlled message shape or gas availability change the economic branch in a way that unbacks or strands funds`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens`
- Entrypoint: `internal helper reached from public finalize and fast paths`
- Attacker controls: token id, recipient account, amount, optional message, current gas budget, and whether the token is wNEAR, deployed, or external
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches.
- Invariant to test: asset-delivery helper logic must not let attacker-controlled message shape or gas availability change the economic branch in a way that unbacks or strands funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state.
