# Q2728: active via collateral-remove: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the set of assets held reach `active` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:238` -> `active`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `active` lists candidate bucket masks at or above a population. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
