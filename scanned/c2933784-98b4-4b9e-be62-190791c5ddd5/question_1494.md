# Q1494: BribeRewardPool.withdrawFor - scaling factor taken from an unrelated staking token

## Question
In rewards/BribeRewardPool.sol, the inherited _provisionReward scales by 10**stakingTokenDecimals, where stakingToken was fixed at construction and is unrelated to the vlMGP-denominated vote balances this pool actually tracks. Does `withdrawFor(address _for, uint256 _amount, bool claim) via WombatBribeManager.vote and unvote` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under totalSupply is zero because every voter has unvoted, so that `_balances[account]` diverges from `totalSupply`, the invariant that the scaling factor must match the unit the balance ledger is denominated in is broken, and the result is Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BribeRewardPool.sol -> `withdrawFor(address _for, uint256 _amount, bool claim) via WombatBribeManager.vote and unvote` (mechanism: scaling factor taken from an unrelated staking token)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdrawFor(address _for, uint256 _amount, bool claim) via WombatBribeManager.vote and unvote`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the negative delta and whether the claim leg runs
- Exploit idea: the inherited _provisionReward scales by 10**stakingTokenDecimals, where stakingToken was fixed at construction and is unrelated to the vlMGP-denominated vote balances this pool actually tracks. Precondition: totalSupply is zero because every voter has unvoted.
- Invariant to test: the scaling factor must match the unit the balance ledger is denominated in; concretely, `_balances[account]` must stay reconciled with `totalSupply`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `withdrawFor(address _for, uint256 _amount, bool claim) via WombatBribeManager.vote and unvote` sequence atomically under totalSupply is zero because every voter has unvoted, asserting at the end that `_balances[account]` still equals `totalSupply` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
