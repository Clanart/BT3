# Q3706: Solana used nonces bucket size storage withdrawal escapes live liabilities at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public finalize instructions through nonce bucketing` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/constants.rs and used_nonces.rs` violate `bucket arithmetic must not let extreme nonce values escape replay protection or corrupt rent compensation across adjacent buckets` in the `storage withdrawal escapes live liabilities` attack class because splits used nonces into fixed-size accounts and computes rent based on the highest seen nonce becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/constants.rs and used_nonces.rs`
- Entrypoint: `public finalize instructions through nonce bucketing`
- Attacker controls: very large destination nonces and the boundary between used-nonce PDAs
- Exploit idea: Look for withdrawals and unregister paths that do not fully account for pending, finalized, or fast-transfer records. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: bucket arithmetic must not let extreme nonce values escape replay protection or corrupt rent compensation across adjacent buckets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Open live bridge state, withdraw aggressively, and assert that storage balances cannot fall below the reserved amount implied by that live state. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
