# Q4915: get-cached-indexes via collateral-add: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
`get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing call ordering within the block, use that to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `collateral-add` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with call ordering within the block, then read `get-cached-indexes` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
