# Q1173: accrue-debt-asset via deposit: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, drive `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) — which calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `deposit` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-debt-asset` touches, run `deposit` with the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
