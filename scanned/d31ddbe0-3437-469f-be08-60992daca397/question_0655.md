# Q655: EVM Wormhole nonce progression origin and destination nonce desynchronization at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public init/deploy/log/finalize flows on Wormhole-backed chains` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::wormholeNonce usage across extensions` violate `Wormhole nonce progression must stay synchronized with actual published messages so a failed publish cannot be replayed or gap-filled by another message class` in the `origin and destination nonce desynchronization` attack class because reuses one incrementing `wormholeNonce` across deploy, metadata, init, and finalize message publication becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::wormholeNonce usage across extensions`
- Entrypoint: `public init/deploy/log/finalize flows on Wormhole-backed chains`
- Attacker controls: message publication ordering, msg.value, and any extension reentrancy or failure mode
- Exploit idea: Drive retries, resume paths, or recursive bridge legs until one deposit appears under more than one transfer identity. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: Wormhole nonce progression must stay synchronized with actual published messages so a failed publish cannot be replayed or gap-filled by another message class
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trace every nonce mutation site and fuzz repeated calls plus reordered callbacks to prove that one deposit cannot create two valid transfer ids or destination messages. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
