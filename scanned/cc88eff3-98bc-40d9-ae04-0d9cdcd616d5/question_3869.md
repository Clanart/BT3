# Q3869: linear-interpolate via call-ststx-ratio: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, drive `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) — which interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)` — to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `call-ststx-ratio` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
