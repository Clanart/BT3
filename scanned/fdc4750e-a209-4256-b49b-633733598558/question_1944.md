# Q1944: store_modified_entry balance prepost mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store_modified_entry` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs around upgrade/close churn with upgrade timing, close/reopen timing, and repeated invocation of the same program id such that balance collection or reporting can disagree with the actual state transition that commits, breaking the invariant that reported balances must match committed balances and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/loaded_programs.rs::store_modified_entry
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs around upgrade/close churn
- Attacker controls: upgrade timing, close/reopen timing, and repeated invocation of the same program id
- Exploit idea: look for mismatches between reported and real lamport deltas
- Invariant to test: reported balances must match committed balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: compare pre/post balances returned by tracing against a direct account diff
