# Q2244: retry_thread balance prepost mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `retry_thread` by use json-rpc `sendtransaction` from one low-rate client with serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and duplicate-signature timing such that balance collection or reporting can disagree with the actual state transition that commits, breaking the invariant that reported balances must match committed balances and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs::retry_thread
- Entrypoint: use JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from one low-rate client
- Attacker controls: serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and duplicate-signature timing
- Exploit idea: look for mismatches between reported and real lamport deltas
- Invariant to test: reported balances must match committed balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: compare pre/post balances returned by tracing against a direct account diff
