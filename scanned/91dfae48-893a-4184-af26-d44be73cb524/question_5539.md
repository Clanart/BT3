# Q5539: get-available-assets via liquidate-redeem: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the borrower targeted, use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, then read `get-available-assets` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
