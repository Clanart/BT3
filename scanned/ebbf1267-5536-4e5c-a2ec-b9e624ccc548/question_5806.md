# Q5806: resolve-callcode via borrow: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-callcode` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349` -> `resolve-callcode`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Reach it through `borrow` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
