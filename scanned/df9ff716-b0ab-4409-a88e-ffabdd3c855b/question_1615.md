# Q1615: process_message account resurrection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_message` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with versioned messages, duplicate accounts, alt expansion, and cpi-heavy instruction graphs such that a zero-lamport or closed account can be revived or reused incorrectly, breaking the invariant that closed or zero-lamport accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs::process_message
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, duplicate accounts, ALT expansion, and CPI-heavy instruction graphs
- Exploit idea: look for stale cache or store ordering that makes dead accounts look live again
- Invariant to test: closed or zero-lamport accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: close and recreate the same account shape repeatedly and diff live/dead visibility
