# Q3954: to clvm commit output after an error path via improper list terminators

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker serialize typed values back into CLVM targeting `to_clvm` in `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs` with improper list terminators at a fork-height or boundary-value activation point make chia_rs commit output after an error path, violating the invariant that FromClvm and ToClvm round trips preserve semantics, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: High. Signature, aggregate signature, synthetic key, puzzle type, condition, timelock, or coin-id validation bypass enables unauthorized spend acceptance or replay?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs:56` / `to_clvm`
- Entrypoint: serialize typed values back into CLVM
- Attacker controls: improper list terminators
- Exploit idea: Drive `to_clvm` through its public caller path using improper list terminators; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: FromClvm and ToClvm round trips preserve semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Signature, aggregate signature, synthetic key, puzzle type, condition, timelock, or coin-id validation bypass enables unauthorized spend acceptance or replay
- Fast validation: fuzz CLVM atoms and lists and assert typed decoding matches clvmr semantics.
