# Q5367: from_condition_aborted_smart_contract: problematic-tx classification depends on node-local state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `from_condition_aborted_smart_contract` (in `stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/transactions.rs`) via a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions), such that `validate_problematic_txs` flags based on config/wall-clock, breaking the invariant that the static verdict for a tx == the same on every node — leading to chain split?

## Target
- File/function: `stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/transactions.rs` -> `from_condition_aborted_smart_contract`
- Entrypoint: a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions)
- Attacker controls: the full auth structure (singlesig/multisig/order-independent/sponsored), nonce, fee, chain id, version, payload, and post-condition list, plus mutation of their own signed transactions
- Exploit idea: `validate_problematic_txs` flags based on config/wall-clock
- Invariant to test: the static verdict for a tx == the same on every node
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - chain split
- Fast validation: test the classifier under two configs
