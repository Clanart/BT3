# Q2374: clean_accounts cleanup drops live state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `clean_accounts` by submit transactions that create, drain, resize, and recreate many accounts with high-churn account creation/close patterns and repeated zero-lamport transitions so that cleanup or compaction can discard still-live attacker-controlled account state, breaking the invariant that live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::clean_accounts
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that create, drain, resize, and recreate many accounts
- Attacker controls: high-churn account creation/close patterns and repeated zero-lamport transitions
- Exploit idea: look for mistaken liveness decisions under fast churn
- Invariant to test: live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn many attacker-owned accounts through close/recreate/update cycles
