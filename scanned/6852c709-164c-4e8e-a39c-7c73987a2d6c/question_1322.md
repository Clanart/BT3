# Q1322: calc-index-next via liquidate: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `min-collateral-expected`, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `liquidate` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `min-collateral-expected` varied, and assert that the value `calc-index-next` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
