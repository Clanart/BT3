# Q2565: modify_accounts hot-stream starvation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `modify_accounts` by submit transactions that update many related accounts in one bank with many writable accounts, cpi-heavy writes, and same-pubkey alias churn so that one hot account/program/signature stream monopolizes work and starves other subscribers, breaking the invariant that one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::modify_accounts
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that update many related accounts in one bank
- Attacker controls: many writable accounts, CPI-heavy writes, and same-pubkey alias churn
- Exploit idea: measure cross-subscriber fairness
- Invariant to test: one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: pair a hot stream with a cheap control subscription
