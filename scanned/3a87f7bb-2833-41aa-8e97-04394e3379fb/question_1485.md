# Q1485: WombatStaking.deposit - bonus reward before-balances captured before an attacker-timed transfer

## Question
In wombat/WombatStaking.sol, _rewardBeforeBalances() snapshots balances immediately before the MasterWombat call, so a bonus token transferred into WombatStaking between the snapshot and the delta is credited as harvested reward and queued to the pool rewarder. Does `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the contract is holding WOM collected as a protocol fee that has not yet been split, so that `IMintableERC20(poolInfo.receiptToken).totalSupply()` diverges from `IMasterWombat(masterWombat) staked balance for poolInfo.pid`, the invariant that harvest accounting must not credit tokens that were not produced by the harvest is broken, and the result is High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatStaking.sol -> `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper` (mechanism: bonus reward before-balances captured before an attacker-timed transfer)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, _minimumLiquidity and _for, forwarded verbatim by WombatPoolHelper/V2/AnkrBNBPoolHelper
- Exploit idea: _rewardBeforeBalances() snapshots balances immediately before the MasterWombat call, so a bonus token transferred into WombatStaking between the snapshot and the delta is credited as harvested reward and queued to the pool rewarder. Precondition: the contract is holding WOM collected as a protocol fee that has not yet been split.
- Invariant to test: harvest accounting must not credit tokens that were not produced by the harvest; concretely, `IMintableERC20(poolInfo.receiptToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `IMasterWombat(masterWombat) staked balance for poolInfo.pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the contract is holding WOM collected as a protocol fee that has not yet been split, call `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper`, and assert `IMintableERC20(poolInfo.receiptToken).totalSupply()` equals `IMasterWombat(masterWombat) staked balance for poolInfo.pid` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
