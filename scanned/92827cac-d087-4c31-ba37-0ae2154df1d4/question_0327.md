# Q327: Desync metadata inside list_unfinalized_fee_payer_utxos

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit the `cancel_outpoints` / `cancel_txids` dependency lists through public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction so `list_unfinalized_fee_payer_utxos` stores or uses metadata that describes a different intent than the raw transaction/proof it later sends, corrupting the binding between raw transaction bytes and the queued tx-sender metadata and violating the invariant that database state must not say a send path is finalized / active when the raw transaction path says otherwise, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/db/tx_sender.rs::list_unfinalized_fee_payer_utxos
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `cancel_outpoints` / `cancel_txids` dependency lists
- Exploit idea: make raw bytes and persisted metadata describe different intents using the `cancel_outpoints` / `cancel_txids` dependency lists
- Invariant to test: database state must not say a send path is finalized / active when the raw transaction path says otherwise
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
