# Q4596: calc-index-next via collateral-add: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position's existing collateral and debt composition reach `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it applies a multiplier to the current index, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `collateral-add` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position's existing collateral and debt composition across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `calc-index-next` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
