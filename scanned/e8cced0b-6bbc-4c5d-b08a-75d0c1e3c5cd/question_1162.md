# Q1162: iter-lookup-debt via borrow: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the future mask produced by the new debt bit, can an unprivileged attacker make `iter-lookup-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218) make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218` -> `iter-lookup-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `borrow` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
