# Q2584: mark_slot_frozen roots-to-flush backlog blowup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `mark_slot_frozen` by submit transactions that maximize write churn near slot boundaries with heavy write churn near slot-freeze boundaries so that attacker-driven write patterns can keep the pending-root backlog large enough to destabilize memory or latency, breaking the invariant that pending roots and flush backlog must stay bounded under valid user workload and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::mark_slot_frozen
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that maximize write churn near slot boundaries
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn near slot-freeze boundaries
- Exploit idea: treat backlog growth as the exploit
- Invariant to test: pending roots and flush backlog must stay bounded under valid user workload
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: drive repeated write bursts across roots and monitor backlog size
