# Q2916: notify_slot_update result-cloning chain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_slot_update` by trigger slot-related subscriptions and then drive hot transaction flow with slow consumer behavior and high-frequency slot events so that large notification objects are cloned more than necessary, breaking the invariant that notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_slot_update
- Entrypoint: trigger slot-related subscriptions and then drive hot transaction flow
- Attacker controls: slow consumer behavior and high-frequency slot events
- Exploit idea: look for repeated clones of the same large object
- Invariant to test: notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: profile allocations and clone counts while delivering large notifications
