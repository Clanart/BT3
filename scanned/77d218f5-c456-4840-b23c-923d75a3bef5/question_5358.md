# Q5358: WombatPoolHelperV2.withdraw - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol - none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _liquidity and _minAmount, under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, exploit this through `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` to break the reconciliation between `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` and the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard, yielding Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity and _minAmount
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, call `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`, and assert `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` equals `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
