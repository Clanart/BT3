# Q1329: EVM init/finalize optional message semantics resume-path replay or duplication at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public `initTransfer`, `initTransfer1155`, and `finTransfer`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol optional `message` handling` violate `optional message semantics must not let an attacker switch the economic branch after the source event is fixed, thereby changing whether callbacks can refund or consume tokens` in the `resume-path replay or duplication` attack class because uses message presence to choose between plain mint and message-based mint on bridge tokens and to include or omit Borsh-encoded message bytes in signatures becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol optional `message` handling`
- Entrypoint: `public `initTransfer`, `initTransfer1155`, and `finTransfer``
- Attacker controls: empty versus non-empty message bytes and recipient contracts that react differently to message-carrying mints
- Exploit idea: Abuse yield/resume or asynchronous callback timing so the same pending outbound transfer is restarted after it already progressed. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: optional message semantics must not let an attacker switch the economic branch after the source event is fixed, thereby changing whether callbacks can refund or consume tokens
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trigger timeouts, duplicate funding, and repeated callback delivery and assert that the resumed transfer either progresses once or cleanly fails once. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
