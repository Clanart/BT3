# Q1074: shopify_id_token: A JWT whose `shopify_domain` claim is an untrusted host, checki...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the Authorization header, the `id_token` URL param, and the JWT body) reach `shopify_id_token / jwt_payload / jwt_shopify_domain` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/with_shopify_id_token.rb via any request to a controller including WithShopifyIdToken (auth, CSRF, ensure_authenticated_links), supplying a JWT whose `shopify_domain` claim is an untrusted host, checking `sanitize_shop_domain` gating in `jwt_shopify_domain`, so that jwt claims must be treated as untrusted until signature/aud/dest are verified by ShopifyAPI is violated, leading to authentication bypass via forged JWT claims? Specifically confirm that a replayed valid artifact yields no new session, token, or side effect.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/with_shopify_id_token.rb — `shopify_id_token / jwt_payload / jwt_shopify_domain`
- Entrypoint: any request to a controller including WithShopifyIdToken (auth, CSRF, ensure_authenticated_links)
- Attacker controls: the Authorization header, the `id_token` URL param, and the JWT body — specifically a JWT whose `shopify_domain` claim is an untrusted host, checking `sanitize_shop_domain` gating in `jwt_shopify_domain`.
- Exploit idea: Replay a previously-valid artifact (token, HMAC body, OAuth code, callback) and confirm it is not re-accepted.
- Invariant to test: jwt claims must be treated as untrusted until signature/aud/dest are verified by ShopifyAPI
- Expected Immunefi impact: authentication bypass via forged JWT claims (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: replay test capturing one valid flow and re-submitting it, asserting no second session/token/side-effect.
