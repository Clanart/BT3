# Q0318: current_shopify_session: A `shop` param that differs from `current_shopify_session.shop`...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` URL param, the Authorization: Bearer header, `shop`, `host`, `session`, and the encrypted session cookie value) reach `current_shopify_session / load_current_session` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb via GET any EnsureHasSession-protected controller action (legacy auth strategy), supplying a `shop` param that differs from `current_shopify_session.shop` to probe `session_shop_conflicts_with_params` bypass, so that the activated session must belong to the shop/user proven by a verified id_token, not by an unverified cookie or param is violated, leading to session fixation / use of another merchant's session (unauthorized data access)? Specifically confirm that merchant A can never load, write, or act with merchant B's session, token, or scopes.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb — `current_shopify_session / load_current_session`
- Entrypoint: GET any EnsureHasSession-protected controller action (legacy auth strategy)
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` URL param, the Authorization: Bearer header, `shop`, `host`, `session`, and the encrypted session cookie value — specifically a `shop` param that differs from `current_shopify_session.shop` to probe `session_shop_conflicts_with_params` bypass.
- Exploit idea: Perform the flow as merchant A while naming shop/user B and confirm no B-scoped data is reachable.
- Invariant to test: the activated session must belong to the shop/user proven by a verified id_token, not by an unverified cookie or param
- Expected Immunefi impact: session fixation / use of another merchant's session (unauthorized data access) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: two-tenant integration test asserting A's request never loads, writes, or acts with B's session/token.
