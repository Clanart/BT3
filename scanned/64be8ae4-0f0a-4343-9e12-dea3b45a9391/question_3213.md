# Q3213: vault-accrue via accrue: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, drive `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) — which dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `accrue` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `vault-accrue` touches, run `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
