# Q5418: mask-to-list-iter via collateral-remove: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-to-list-iter` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `mask-to-list-iter` appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440` -> `mask-to-list-iter`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-iter` appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `mask-to-list-iter` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
