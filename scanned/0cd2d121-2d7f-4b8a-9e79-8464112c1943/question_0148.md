# Q0148: merge-price via collateral-remove-redeem: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver` for the underlying leg reach `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `receiver` for the underlying leg, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
