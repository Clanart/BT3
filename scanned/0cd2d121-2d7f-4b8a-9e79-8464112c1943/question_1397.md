# Q1397: convert-to-scaled-debt via collateral-remove-redeem: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `receiver` for the underlying leg, drive `convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) — which scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `receiver` for the underlying leg, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
