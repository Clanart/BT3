# Q2945: Decouple emergency protection in create_watchtower_challenge_timeout_txhandler

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker push attacker-controlled the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context through public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `create_watchtower_challenge_timeout_txhandler` advances the main settlement path while the emergency-stop or recovery path remains tied to a different context, corrupting the operator signature set attached to a deposit and breaking the invariant that partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/builder/transaction/challenge.rs::create_watchtower_challenge_timeout_txhandler
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context
- Exploit idea: advance the main path while protection/recovery remains tied to another context
- Invariant to test: partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
