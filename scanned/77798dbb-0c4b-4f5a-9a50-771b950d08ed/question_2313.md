# Q2313: payload can serve state that disagrees with the cache (tx_loop.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `payload` in `xdp/src/tx_loop.rs` with a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing, and make the packet length declared in the batch header disagree with the bytes actually parsed from the datagram, so that the invariant "Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `xdp/src/tx_loop.rs` -> `payload()` (around line 210)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing
- Exploit idea: Make `payload` read a cached value the attacker already invalidated, so a node with a warm cache commits different state than one that reloaded.
- Invariant to test: Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Test the path with the cache primed and cleared; assert the committed state is identical in both runs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy or upgrade a program, or poison the program cache, so honest validators execute different bytecode or produce different results for the same instruction.
