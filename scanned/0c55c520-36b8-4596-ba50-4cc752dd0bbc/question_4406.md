# Q4406: calc-liq-factor-exp via liquidate: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liq-factor-exp` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:708) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `calc-liq-factor-exp` uses `(/ exp BPS)` as an integer exponent for `pow` and falls back to `sqrti` below BPS, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:708` -> `calc-liq-factor-exp`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-exp` uses `(/ exp BPS)` as an integer exponent for `pow` and falls back to `sqrti` below BPS. Reach it through `liquidate` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering varied, and assert that the value `calc-liq-factor-exp` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
