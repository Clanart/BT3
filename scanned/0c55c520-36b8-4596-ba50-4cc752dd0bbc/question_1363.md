# Q1363: process-collateral-asset via liquidate: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`process-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:789) computes expected collateral, then caps it at the borrower's balance. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `debt-amount`, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:789` -> `process-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `process-collateral-asset` computes expected collateral, then caps it at the borrower's balance. Reach it through `liquidate` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, then read `process-collateral-asset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
