# Q2284: retry_durable_nonce_transactions alias lock divergence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `retry_durable_nonce_transactions` by use json-rpc `sendtransaction` from one low-rate client with durable nonce transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and queue pressure such that duplicated writable/read-only aliases and ALT-expanded account lists make the lock view here differ from the later execution or commit view, breaking the invariant that a transaction must have one canonical writable/read-only account view from sanitize through commit and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs::retry_durable_nonce_transactions
- Entrypoint: use JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from one low-rate client
- Attacker controls: durable nonce transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and queue pressure
- Exploit idea: turn one logical account set into two inconsistent internal views so conflict detection is bypassed or retries spin forever
- Invariant to test: a transaction must have one canonical writable/read-only account view from sanitize through commit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace the lock set, loaded account set, and committed writes for ALT-heavy duplicated-account transactions
