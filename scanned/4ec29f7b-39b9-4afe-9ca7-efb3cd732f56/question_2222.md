# Q2222: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getRewards - forfeit erased by settling during cooldown

## Question
Note that in rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, _calExpireForfeit() multiplies the pending amount by vlMGP.getRewardablePercentWAD(_account), which stays at exactly 1e18 for the whole cooldown window, so a user who has already started their exit forfeits nothing. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` under the computed forfeit lands just above the _amount / 1000 dust threshold and force `forfeitAmount` apart from `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored`, breaking the invariant that the forfeit must reflect the lock commitment actually served, not the settlement instant the user chose for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: forfeit erased by settling during cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: _calExpireForfeit() multiplies the pending amount by vlMGP.getRewardablePercentWAD(_account), which stays at exactly 1e18 for the whole cooldown window, so a user who has already started their exit forfeits nothing. Precondition: the computed forfeit lands just above the _amount / 1000 dust threshold.
- Invariant to test: the forfeit must reflect the lock commitment actually served, not the settlement instant the user chose; concretely, `forfeitAmount` must stay reconciled with `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the computed forfeit lands just above the _amount / 1000 dust threshold, have the attacker run `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `forfeitAmount` versus `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
