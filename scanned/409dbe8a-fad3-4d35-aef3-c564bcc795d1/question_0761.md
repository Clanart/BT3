# Q761: Misbind storage-proof semantics in collect_deposit_move_txids

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes so `collect_deposit_move_txids` treats one storage slot, value, or path as proving another, corrupting the L1/L2 height pair treated as finalized and safe to bridge against and violating the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/citrea.rs::collect_deposit_move_txids
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Exploit idea: treat one storage slot/value/path as if it proved another using light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
