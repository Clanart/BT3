# Q2656: resolve-interpolation-points via liquidate: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering reach `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
