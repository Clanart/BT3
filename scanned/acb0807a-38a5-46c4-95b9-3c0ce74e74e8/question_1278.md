# Q1278: NEAR UTXO other-chain forwarder fee and principal split divergence at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public UTXO branch reached through `ft_on_transfer`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::utxo_fin_transfer_to_other_chain` violate `UTXO forwarding must not let one origin UTXO create multiple cross-chain obligations with inconsistent fee or recipient binding` in the `fee and principal split divergence` attack class because turns a verified UTXO-origin transfer into a new pending transfer for another chain after allocating a new origin nonce and destination nonce becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::utxo_fin_transfer_to_other_chain`
- Entrypoint: `public UTXO branch reached through `ft_on_transfer``
- Attacker controls: UTXO transfer message, origin chain, destination chain, relayer fee, and fast-transfer status
- Exploit idea: Focus on branches where fee checks happen before normalization, denormalization, callback resolution, or storage billing. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: UTXO forwarding must not let one origin UTXO create multiple cross-chain obligations with inconsistent fee or recipient binding
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Fuzz amount/fee/native-fee edge cases around zero, max, and decimal boundaries and assert that emitted value plus stored fee always equals consumed value. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
