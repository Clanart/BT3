# Q285: NEAR transfer message storage encoding origin and destination nonce desynchronization via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public resume/sign/finalize paths that hash or persist transfer records` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::TransferMessageStorage::encode_borsh` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `origin and destination nonce desynchronization` under serializes pending transfer records that later feed signing, resume, fee claim, and settlement logic, violating `persisted transfer bytes must stay canonical so stored state cannot be reinterpreted under another message hash or transfer id`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::TransferMessageStorage::encode_borsh`
- Entrypoint: `public resume/sign/finalize paths that hash or persist transfer records`
- Attacker controls: all stored transfer fields including origin nonce, destination nonce, fee, sender, recipient, and optional origin transfer id
- Exploit idea: Drive retries, resume paths, or recursive bridge legs until one deposit appears under more than one transfer identity. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: persisted transfer bytes must stay canonical so stored state cannot be reinterpreted under another message hash or transfer id
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trace every nonce mutation site and fuzz repeated calls plus reordered callbacks to prove that one deposit cannot create two valid transfer ids or destination messages. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
