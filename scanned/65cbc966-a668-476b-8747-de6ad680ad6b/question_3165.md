# Q3165: Parse a malformed object path in list_unfinalized_cancel_outpoints

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft the `signed_tx_hex` payload so `list_unfinalized_cancel_outpoints` parses, hashes, or stores one object while later logic signs, verifies, or settles a meaningfully different one, corrupting the finalized/seen-at-height status recorded for the send request and violating the invariant that RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent, leading to Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/db/tx_sender.rs::list_unfinalized_cancel_outpoints
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Exploit idea: parse, hash, or store one object while later logic settles another by crafting the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Invariant to test: RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
