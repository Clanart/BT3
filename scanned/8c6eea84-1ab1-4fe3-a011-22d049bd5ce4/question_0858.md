# Q858: NEAR bind_token callback partial deployment rollback leaves live alias via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `proof callback for public `bind_token`` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token_callback` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `partial deployment rollback leaves live alias` under adds the token mapping, initializes `locked_tokens` for the foreign asset, measures storage delta, and requires sufficient attached deposit before emitting the bind event, violating `a token binding must not be replayable or partially writable in a way that creates duplicate mappings, inconsistent lock rows, or underfunded state`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token_callback`
- Entrypoint: `proof callback for public `bind_token``
- Attacker controls: decoded deploy-token message, chain kind, foreign token address, decimals, origin decimals, and attached deposit
- Exploit idea: Look for deployment flows that cross multiple contracts or callbacks before all state is committed. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: a token binding must not be replayable or partially writable in a way that creates duplicate mappings, inconsistent lock rows, or underfunded state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each subcall to fail independently and assert that the resulting state is either fully rolled back or fully usable, never half-bound. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
