# Q1577: Solana log_metadata fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Solana `log_metadata` instruction` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::log_metadata` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical` under reads Solana token metadata and posts it back toward Near for cross-chain deployment flows, violating `metadata publication must not let a malicious mint or metadata account manufacture a remote asset identity that diverges from actual custody semantics`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::log_metadata`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `log_metadata` instruction`
- Attacker controls: mint account, metadata account contents, payer funding, and published payload fields
- Exploit idea: Target checks that only inspect mint authority, owner, or one mapping row without proving the full asset identity. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: metadata publication must not let a malicious mint or metadata account manufacture a remote asset identity that diverges from actual custody semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Construct plausible fake bridge-controlled assets and assert that deployment, settlement, and forwarding reject them unless they are the canonical mapping for that remote asset. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
