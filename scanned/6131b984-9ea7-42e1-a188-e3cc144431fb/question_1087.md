# Q1087: process_transaction_with_metadata fee-charge mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_transaction_with_metadata` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with instruction order, duplicated accounts, nonce/blockhash choices, fee / compute settings, and metadata-heavy execution such that fee-payer debiting or fee calculation can diverge from the execution result that this function eventually commits or reports, breaking the invariant that fees charged, reported, and committed must match one another and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::process_transaction_with_metadata
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: instruction order, duplicated accounts, nonce/blockhash choices, fee / compute settings, and metadata-heavy execution
- Exploit idea: create an execution that undercharges or misattributes fees relative to actual work
- Invariant to test: fees charged, reported, and committed must match one another
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: compare declared fees, charged lamports, and committed fee counters
