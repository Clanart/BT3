# Q3213: filter_logs_results slow-consumer retention

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_logs_results` by use in-scope logs subscriptions with legal filters with logs filters, encodings, and log-heavy transactions so that one slow subscriber can make state created around this function accumulate without bound, breaking the invariant that one slow subscriber must not create unbounded retained notification state and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_logs_results
- Entrypoint: use in-scope logs subscriptions with legal filters
- Attacker controls: logs filters, encodings, and log-heavy transactions
- Exploit idea: treat queue retention as the bug class
- Invariant to test: one slow subscriber must not create unbounded retained notification state
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: stop reading from one websocket and monitor retained notification memory
