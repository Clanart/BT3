# Q78: Replay context into nonce_gen

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with attacker-controlled the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` so `nonce_gen` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the operator signature set attached to a deposit to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/verifier.rs::nonce_gen
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
