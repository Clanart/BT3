# Q1598: get-asset-value via liquidate: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `min-collateral-expected`, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `liquidate` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `min-collateral-expected` varied, and assert that the value `get-asset-value` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
