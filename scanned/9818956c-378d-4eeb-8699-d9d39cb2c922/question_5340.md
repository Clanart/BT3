# Q5340: resolve-price-feed via collateral-remove-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem reach `resolve-price-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332) in a state where it satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? Given that it dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332` -> `resolve-price-feed`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `resolve-price-feed` dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `resolve-price-feed` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
