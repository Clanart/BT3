# Q3307: total-assets via supply-collateral-add: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, then read `total-assets` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
