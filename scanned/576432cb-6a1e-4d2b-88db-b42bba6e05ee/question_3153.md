# Q3153: filter_signature_result flush-path service pinning

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_signature_result` by use in-scope signature subscriptions and many status changes with signature subscription parameters and hot status churn so that a legal transaction/read pattern can force this path into a flush-heavy mode that blocks unrelated work, breaking the invariant that background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_signature_result
- Entrypoint: use in-scope signature subscriptions and many status changes
- Attacker controls: signature subscription parameters and hot status churn
- Exploit idea: treat flush pressure as the resource
- Invariant to test: background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: run churn-heavy writes plus immediate reads and measure latency inflation
