# Q2967: notify_signatures_received queue-drain mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_signatures_received` by subscribe to signatures and then submit many status-changing transactions with signature subscriptions, duplicate-signature churn, and slow consumer behavior so that the queue behind this function drains more slowly than one valid subscription shape can fill it even at realistic rates, breaking the invariant that one valid subscription must not create a persistently negative drain ratio and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_signatures_received
- Entrypoint: subscribe to signatures and then submit many status-changing transactions
- Attacker controls: signature subscriptions, duplicate-signature churn, and slow consumer behavior
- Exploit idea: treat steady-state drain ratio as the invariant
- Invariant to test: one valid subscription must not create a persistently negative drain ratio
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: measure fill/drain ratio for the hottest legal notification source
