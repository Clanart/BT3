# Q2664: read_only_accounts_cache.store watcher leak on disconnect

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that cause cache population for large accounts with repeated reads of large or frequently changing accounts so that disconnect/unsubscribe races leave watcher state or queued notifications behind, breaking the invariant that watcher teardown must reclaim all state promptly and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs::store
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that cause cache population for large accounts
- Attacker controls: repeated reads of large or frequently changing accounts
- Exploit idea: stress teardown paths
- Invariant to test: watcher teardown must reclaim all state promptly
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: rapidly connect/disconnect and compare live watcher counts before and after
