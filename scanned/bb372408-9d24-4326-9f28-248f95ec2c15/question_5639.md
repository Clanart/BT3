# Q5639: calc-multiplier-delta via deposit: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
`calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, use that to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `deposit` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `deposit` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
