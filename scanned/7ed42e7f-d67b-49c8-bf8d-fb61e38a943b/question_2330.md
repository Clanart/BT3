# Q2330: servicer reserved-key bypass

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `servicer` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one client with packet layouts, signature counts, versioned messages, and duplicate-account transaction shapes such that duplicated accounts or versioned message features let attacker-controlled keys slip past reserved-key assumptions, breaking the invariant that reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/sigverify_stage.rs::servicer
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one client
- Attacker controls: packet layouts, signature counts, versioned messages, and duplicate-account transaction shapes
- Exploit idea: search for paths where reserved-key checks see a different key set than execution
- Invariant to test: reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: construct versioned transactions whose ALT-expanded account set changes the effective key view
