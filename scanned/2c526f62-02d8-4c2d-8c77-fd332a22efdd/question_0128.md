# Q0128: redirect_to_login: An `access_scopes` array param that is joined into `scope=` and...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`return_to`, `shop`, `host`, the Referer header, and arbitrary extra query params) reach `redirect_to_login / return_to_url / login_url_params` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb via GET a protected action while unauthenticated (triggers redirect_to_login), supplying an `access_scopes` array param that is joined into `scope=` and reflected into the login URL, so that attacker Referer/params must not silently choose the shop the login flow authorizes is violated, leading to authorization to an attacker-chosen shop (cross-shop access)? Specifically confirm that a nil/blank derived value fails closed and never becomes a trusted default.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb — `redirect_to_login / return_to_url / login_url_params`
- Entrypoint: GET a protected action while unauthenticated (triggers redirect_to_login)
- Attacker controls: `return_to`, `shop`, `host`, the Referer header, and arbitrary extra query params — specifically an `access_scopes` array param that is joined into `scope=` and reflected into the login URL.
- Exploit idea: Drive the input to nil/blank/empty and confirm the code fails closed rather than defaulting to a trusted value.
- Invariant to test: attacker Referer/params must not silently choose the shop the login flow authorizes
- Expected Immunefi impact: authorization to an attacker-chosen shop (cross-shop access) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: boundary test feeding nil/blank/empty and asserting a hard reject, never a wildcard/default shop or skipped check.
