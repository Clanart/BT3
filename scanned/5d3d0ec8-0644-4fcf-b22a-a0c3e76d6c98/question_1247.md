# Q1247: add-user-scaled-debt via liquidate-multi: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`add-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237) adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237` -> `add-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the trait principals supplied per entry, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
