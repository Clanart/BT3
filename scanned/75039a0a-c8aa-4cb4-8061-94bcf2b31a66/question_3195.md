# Q3195: filter_logs_results write-cache ordering drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_logs_results` by use in-scope logs subscriptions with legal filters with logs filters, encodings, and log-heavy transactions so that writeback ordering can make later readers observe a different account version than accounting code assumed, breaking the invariant that write-cache ordering must preserve one coherent latest-account view and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_logs_results
- Entrypoint: use in-scope logs subscriptions with legal filters
- Attacker controls: logs filters, encodings, and log-heavy transactions
- Exploit idea: search for ordering-sensitive reads around flush/writeback boundaries
- Invariant to test: write-cache ordering must preserve one coherent latest-account view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace storage writes and immediate reads during slot/root churn
