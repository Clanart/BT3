# Q2465: get_pubkey_account_for_slot hot-stream starvation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `get_pubkey_account_for_slot` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads while transactions keep rewriting one pubkey with same-pubkey rewrites across slots, immediate reads, and cached-versus-storage lookups so that one hot account/program/signature stream monopolizes work and starves other subscribers, breaking the invariant that one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::get_pubkey_account_for_slot
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads while transactions keep rewriting one pubkey
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey rewrites across slots, immediate reads, and cached-versus-storage lookups
- Exploit idea: measure cross-subscriber fairness
- Invariant to test: one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: pair a hot stream with a cheap control subscription
