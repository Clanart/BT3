# Q0715: set_account mishandles duplicate/aliased accounts (account_overrides.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `set_account` in `svm/src/account_overrides.rs` with a zero-lamport or exactly-rent-exempt-minus-one account, and have `set_account` read a stale copy of an account passed twice in the same instruction, so that the invariant "Aliased account references observe a single coherent value throughout the instruction." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/account_overrides.rs` -> `set_account()` (around line 16)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a zero-lamport or exactly-rent-exempt-minus-one account
- Exploit idea: Pass the same account at two indices so `set_account` reads a stale copy and writes back a value computed from it, duplicating or erasing a balance.
- Invariant to test: Aliased account references observe a single coherent value throughout the instruction.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Unit test the path with the same pubkey at two indices; assert the final lamports match the single-reference case.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy a program that reads or writes host/guest memory outside its permitted regions, or forges an account reference, and extracts or corrupts state belonging to other accounts.
