# Q1024: commit_transactions alias lock divergence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `commit_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transactions that partially fail, write many accounts, resize data, and alter fees or rent state such that duplicated writable/read-only aliases and ALT-expanded account lists make the lock view here differ from the later execution or commit view, breaking the invariant that a transaction must have one canonical writable/read-only account view from sanitize through commit and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::commit_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transactions that partially fail, write many accounts, resize data, and alter fees or rent state
- Exploit idea: turn one logical account set into two inconsistent internal views so conflict detection is bypassed or retries spin forever
- Invariant to test: a transaction must have one canonical writable/read-only account view from sanitize through commit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace the lock set, loaded account set, and committed writes for ALT-heavy duplicated-account transactions
