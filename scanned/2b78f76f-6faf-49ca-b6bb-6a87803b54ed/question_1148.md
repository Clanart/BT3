# Q1148: Exploit ordering assumptions in fetch_block_info_from_height

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use attacker-controlled reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height so `fetch_block_info_from_height` validates the right inputs in the wrong order, corrupting the canonical header-chain state and total work and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/bitcoin_syncer.rs::fetch_block_info_from_height
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: validate the right pieces in the wrong order using reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
