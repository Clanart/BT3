# Q3961: EVM init/finalize optional message semantics delivery callback leaves inconsistent state via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `initTransfer`, `initTransfer1155`, and `finTransfer`` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol optional `message` handling` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `delivery callback leaves inconsistent state` under uses message presence to choose between plain mint and message-based mint on bridge tokens and to include or omit Borsh-encoded message bytes in signatures, violating `optional message semantics must not let an attacker switch the economic branch after the source event is fixed, thereby changing whether callbacks can refund or consume tokens`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol optional `message` handling`
- Entrypoint: `public `initTransfer`, `initTransfer1155`, and `finTransfer``
- Attacker controls: empty versus non-empty message bytes and recipient contracts that react differently to message-carrying mints
- Exploit idea: Focus on `ft_transfer_call`, unwrap callbacks, and post-delivery resolution that decide whether to burn, refund, or remove records. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: optional message semantics must not let an attacker switch the economic branch after the source event is fixed, thereby changing whether callbacks can refund or consume tokens
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Enumerate callback results and assert that each result maps to exactly one consistent combination of delivered value, replay state, and storage refund. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
