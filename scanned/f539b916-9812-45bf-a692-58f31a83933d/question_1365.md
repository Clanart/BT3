# Q1365: accrue-debt-asset via collateral-remove-redeem: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, drive `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) — which calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-debt-asset` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
