# Q4892: calc-liq-debt-repay via liquidate-redeem: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `calc-liq-debt-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay` takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the borrower targeted varied, and assert that the value `calc-liq-debt-repay` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
