# Q3826: merge-price via borrow: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `borrow` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
