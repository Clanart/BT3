# Q1948: WombatStaking.harvest - harvest reverts on a manipulated smart convert and blocks deposits and withdrawals

## Question
wombat/WombatStaking.sol: SmartWomConvert.smartConvert passes _minRec equal to _amountIn, so a manipulated pool makes it revert, and because _sendRewards runs inside _toMasterWomAndSendReward it is on the path of every deposit, depositLP and withdraw for that pool. With _lpToken and the timing of every harvest-driven fee split under attacker control and a fee entry with isMWOM set is active and smartWomConverter is a live SmartWomConvert, can an unprivileged caller sequence `harvest(address _lpToken)` so that `IERC20(poolInfo.lpAddress).balanceOf(address(this))` and `lpReceived credited by IMintableERC20(receiptToken).mint` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a manipulable external price must not be able to block principal deposits and withdrawals and realising High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatStaking.sol -> `harvest(address _lpToken)` (mechanism: harvest reverts on a manipulated smart convert and blocks deposits and withdrawals)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest(address _lpToken)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpToken and the timing of every harvest-driven fee split
- Exploit idea: SmartWomConvert.smartConvert passes _minRec equal to _amountIn, so a manipulated pool makes it revert, and because _sendRewards runs inside _toMasterWomAndSendReward it is on the path of every deposit, depositLP and withdraw for that pool. Precondition: a fee entry with isMWOM set is active and smartWomConverter is a live SmartWomConvert.
- Invariant to test: a manipulable external price must not be able to block principal deposits and withdrawals; concretely, `IERC20(poolInfo.lpAddress).balanceOf(address(this))` must stay reconciled with `lpReceived credited by IMintableERC20(receiptToken).mint`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange a fee entry with isMWOM set is active and smartWomConverter is a live SmartWomConvert, call `harvest(address _lpToken)`, and assert `IERC20(poolInfo.lpAddress).balanceOf(address(this))` equals `lpReceived credited by IMintableERC20(receiptToken).mint` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
