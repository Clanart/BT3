# Q3159: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.deposit - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
Consider wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, where the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Assuming a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` and `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, breaking the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value and producing Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, then assert `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` and `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` end identical in both runs.
