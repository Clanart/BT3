# Q1607: NEAR per-chain token origin detection asset mapping drifts away from actual token semantics via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public init/finalize/lock flows through token-origin checks` and then replay or reorder the adjacent bridge step that consumes the same state so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::get_token_origin_chain` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `asset mapping drifts away from actual token semantics` under infers origin chain from deployment caches, UTXO config, or token-account naming conventions before deciding whether to lock/unlock liquidity, violating `origin-chain inference must never let an attacker make the bridge classify a token as native when it is wrapped, or vice versa, because that changes custody accounting`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::get_token_origin_chain`
- Entrypoint: `public init/finalize/lock flows through token-origin checks`
- Attacker controls: token account ids whose prefixes influence inferred origin chain and whether the token is in deployed sets or UTXO configs
- Exploit idea: Target upgrades, migration swaps, fake bridge-controlled tokens, and deploy callbacks. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: origin-chain inference must never let an attacker make the bridge classify a token as native when it is wrapped, or vice versa, because that changes custody accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Change token semantics around an existing mapping and assert that the bridge does not keep treating the token as a valid canonical representation. Then replay or reorder the adjacent bridge step that consumes the same state and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
