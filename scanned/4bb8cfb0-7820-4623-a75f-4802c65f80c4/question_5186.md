# Q5186: scale-debt-for-liquidation via liquidate: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `scale-debt-for-liquidation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `scale-debt-for-liquidation` re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858` -> `scale-debt-for-liquidation`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `scale-debt-for-liquidation` re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped. Reach it through `liquidate` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `borrower`, any third-party principal varied, and assert that the value `scale-debt-for-liquidation` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
