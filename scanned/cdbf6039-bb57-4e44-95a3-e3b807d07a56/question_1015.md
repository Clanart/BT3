# Q1015: debt-add-scaled via transfer: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
`debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing `amount`, use that to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, violating the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `transfer` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `transfer` with `amount`, then read `debt-add-scaled` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
