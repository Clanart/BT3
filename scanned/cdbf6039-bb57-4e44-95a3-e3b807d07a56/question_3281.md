# Q3281: mask-update via borrow: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, drive `mask-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:94) — which sets or clears one bit, clearing only when the row reaches exactly zero — to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:94` -> `mask-update`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `mask-update` sets or clears one bit, clearing only when the row reaches exactly zero. Reach it through `borrow` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
