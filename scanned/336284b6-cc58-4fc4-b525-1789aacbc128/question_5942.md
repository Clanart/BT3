# Q5942: resolve-or-create via collateral-remove: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `resolve-or-create` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
