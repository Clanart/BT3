# Q1161: verify_transaction ALT account explosion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `verify_transaction` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with versioned message features, duplicate accounts, precompiles, and boundary serialized forms such that address lookup tables make this function handle a much larger effective account surface than the early admission logic prices, breaking the invariant that versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::verify_transaction
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: versioned message features, duplicate accounts, precompiles, and boundary serialized forms
- Exploit idea: use legal ALT expansion to amplify load, lock, or verification work
- Invariant to test: versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: benchmark identical logic with and without ALT expansion
