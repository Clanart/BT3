# Q421: Solana UsedNonces::use_nonce replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public nonce-tracking path through `finalize_transfer` instructions` with control over destination nonce, used-nonces PDA slot, payer funding, authority PDA lamports, and nonce gaps and desynchronize `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs::use_nonce` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly` attack class because tracks nonce usage in bit arrays, updates `max_used_nonce`, and compensates or charges rent to the authority reserve as nonce ranges expand, violating `nonce tracking must reject every replay while keeping reserve accounting exact, even under gaps, huge nonces, or interleaved PDA initialization`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs::use_nonce`
- Entrypoint: `public nonce-tracking path through `finalize_transfer` instructions`
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, used-nonces PDA slot, payer funding, authority PDA lamports, and nonce gaps
- Exploit idea: Stress replay-protection state keyed only by nonce, transfer id, or bitmap position across branches and chains. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: nonce tracking must reject every replay while keeping reserve accounting exact, even under gaps, huge nonces, or interleaved PDA initialization
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Replay valid proofs/signatures with altered non-economic fields and assert that only the exact originally-settled event is rejected as already used. Also assert cross-module consistency between `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs::use_nonce` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
