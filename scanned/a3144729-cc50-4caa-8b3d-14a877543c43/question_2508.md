# Q2508: current_shopify_session_id: An `id_token` for shop A while `shop` param is shop B, testing ...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params) reach `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb via GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy, supplying an `id_token` for shop A while `shop` param is shop B, testing `reject_mismatched_requested_shopify_domain`, so that token exchange must not persist a session for a shop asserted only by an unverified claim is violated, leading to unauthorized offline access-token acquisition (token theft)? Specifically confirm that the activated session binds to the verified token's shop/user, never a disagreeing cookie/param.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb — `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange`
- Entrypoint: GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params — specifically an `id_token` for shop A while `shop` param is shop B, testing `reject_mismatched_requested_shopify_domain`.
- Exploit idea: Present a cookie and a token that disagree on shop/user and confirm the verified token wins, not the cookie.
- Invariant to test: token exchange must not persist a session for a shop asserted only by an unverified claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: unauthorized offline access-token acquisition (token theft) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: test with a mismatched cookie/token pair asserting the session binds to the verified token's shop/user only.
