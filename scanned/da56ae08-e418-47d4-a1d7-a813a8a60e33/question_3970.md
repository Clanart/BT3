# Q3970: is-healthy-with-mask via supply-collateral-add: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
