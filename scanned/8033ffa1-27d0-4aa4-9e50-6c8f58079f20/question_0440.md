# Q0440: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getRewards - queueMGP(uint256,address,address) is the MGP entry point used by MasterMagpie._sendMGPForVlMGPPool

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, this additional entry point widens who can move the pool's accounting state, so the set of actors able to choose when the reward index changes is larger than the manager role the design assumes. Does `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the account is inside its cooldown window so getRewardablePercentWAD is exactly 1e18, so that `totalStaked()` diverges from `IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply()`, the invariant that only an authorised manager may decide when and by how much the reward index moves is broken, and the result is High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: queueMGP(uint256,address,address) is the MGP entry point used by MasterMagpie._sendMGPForVlMGPPool)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: this additional entry point widens who can move the pool's accounting state, so the set of actors able to choose when the reward index changes is larger than the manager role the design assumes. Precondition: the account is inside its cooldown window so getRewardablePercentWAD is exactly 1e18.
- Invariant to test: only an authorised manager may decide when and by how much the reward index moves; concretely, `totalStaked()` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply()`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` sequence atomically under the account is inside its cooldown window so getRewardablePercentWAD is exactly 1e18, asserting at the end that `totalStaked()` still equals `IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply()` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
