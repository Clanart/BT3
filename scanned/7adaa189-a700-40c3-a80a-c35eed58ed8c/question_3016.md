# Q3016: notify_roots result-cloning chain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_roots` by subscribe to roots and then drive hot slot/root movement with root subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot root movement so that large notification objects are cloned more than necessary, breaking the invariant that notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_roots
- Entrypoint: subscribe to roots and then drive hot slot/root movement
- Attacker controls: root subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot root movement
- Exploit idea: look for repeated clones of the same large object
- Invariant to test: notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: profile allocations and clone counts while delivering large notifications
