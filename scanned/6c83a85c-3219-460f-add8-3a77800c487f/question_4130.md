# Q4130: ReferralStorage.claimReward - sqrt factor makes many small accounts dominate the denominator

## Question
In rewards/ReferralStorage.sol, userInfo.factor is DSMath.sqrt(lockedAmount), so splitting one lock across many addresses raises the summed factor relative to a single large lock and shifts the shared BoostPoint toward the splitter. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `claimReward()` while sharePercent is set so most of the split goes to the referrer, and drive `userInfos[account].factor` out of agreement with `DSMath.sqrt(IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(account))` - breaking the invariant that a boost weight must not reward splitting one position across addresses - for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/ReferralStorage.sol -> `claimReward()` (mechanism: sqrt factor makes many small accounts dominate the denominator)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `claimReward()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the moment the accrued MGP is drawn from the shared contract balance
- Exploit idea: userInfo.factor is DSMath.sqrt(lockedAmount), so splitting one lock across many addresses raises the summed factor relative to a single large lock and shifts the shared BoostPoint toward the splitter. Precondition: sharePercent is set so most of the split goes to the referrer.
- Invariant to test: a boost weight must not reward splitting one position across addresses; concretely, `userInfos[account].factor` must stay reconciled with `DSMath.sqrt(IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(account))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange sharePercent is set so most of the split goes to the referrer, call `claimReward()`, and assert `userInfos[account].factor` equals `DSMath.sqrt(IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(account))` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
