# Q2406: safe_embedded_app_url: A `host` decoding empty after base64, exercising the empty-stri...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the base64 `host` param, or the `shop` param used to synthesize host) reach `safe_embedded_app_url / deduced_phishing_attack? / unsafe_embedded_host?` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/embedded_app.rb via GET a page that redirects to the embedded admin (invalid-token path, ensure_installed), supplying a `host` decoding empty after base64, exercising the empty-string early return, so that the decoded embedded host must resolve to a Shopify admin origin for the acting shop only is violated, leading to open redirect to attacker origin carrying id_token/host (token exfiltration)? Specifically confirm that the error/rescue branch fails closed and leaks no token or secret.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/embedded_app.rb — `safe_embedded_app_url / deduced_phishing_attack? / unsafe_embedded_host?`
- Entrypoint: GET a page that redirects to the embedded admin (invalid-token path, ensure_installed)
- Attacker controls: the base64 `host` param, or the `shop` param used to synthesize host — specifically a `host` decoding empty after base64, exercising the empty-string early return.
- Exploit idea: Force the rescued/exception branch and confirm it fails closed without leaking secrets or granting a session.
- Invariant to test: the decoded embedded host must resolve to a Shopify admin origin for the acting shop only
- Expected Immunefi impact: open redirect to attacker origin carrying id_token/host (token exfiltration) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: error-injection test asserting the rescue branch yields no session, no token, and no secret in the response/log.
