# Q3369: EVM ENearProxy finaliseNearToEthTransfer shared proof response reused across entrypoints via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public legacy proof-submission entrypoint` and then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint so that `evm/src/eNear/contracts/ENearProxy.sol::finaliseNearToEthTransfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `shared proof response reused across entrypoints` under delegates proof validation to `prover.proveOutcome` and then forwards the same proof into `eNear.finaliseNearToEthTransfer`, violating `legacy proof validation must reject stale, replayed, cross-context, or partially-validated proofs that can mint eNEAR more than once`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/eNear/contracts/ENearProxy.sol::finaliseNearToEthTransfer`
- Entrypoint: `public legacy proof-submission entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, proof block height, and timing relative to current receipt id and pause state
- Exploit idea: Attack systems where one verifier contract serves deploy, finalize, metadata, and fee-claim flows with a shared result type. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: legacy proof validation must reject stale, replayed, cross-context, or partially-validated proofs that can mint eNEAR more than once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Attempt to route accepted verifier outputs into every public proof consumer and assert that each entrypoint only accepts its intended result variant and source semantics. Then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
