# Q0935: mWomSV.unlock - mWomSV has no forceUnLock so value can only leave through the full cooldown

## Question
wombat/mWomSV.sol: unlike VLMGP, wombat/mWomSV.sol exposes no forceUnLock path, so a slot whose accounting becomes inconsistent has no penalty-bearing escape hatch and the mWOM behind it cannot be recovered. With _slotIndex and the redemption timing under attacker control and the attacker's slot matured one block ago, can an unprivileged caller sequence `unlock(uint256 _slotIndex)` so that `userUnlockings[user][i].amountInCoolDown` and `maxSlot` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that every locked position must retain at least one reachable exit path under all reachable states and realising Critical - Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWomSV.sol -> `unlock(uint256 _slotIndex)` (mechanism: mWomSV has no forceUnLock so value can only leave through the full cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `unlock(uint256 _slotIndex)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _slotIndex and the redemption timing
- Exploit idea: unlike VLMGP, wombat/mWomSV.sol exposes no forceUnLock path, so a slot whose accounting becomes inconsistent has no penalty-bearing escape hatch and the mWOM behind it cannot be recovered. Precondition: the attacker's slot matured one block ago.
- Invariant to test: every locked position must retain at least one reachable exit path under all reachable states; concretely, `userUnlockings[user][i].amountInCoolDown` must stay reconciled with `maxSlot`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `unlock(uint256 _slotIndex)` sequence atomically under the attacker's slot matured one block ago, asserting at the end that `userUnlockings[user][i].amountInCoolDown` still equals `maxSlot` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
