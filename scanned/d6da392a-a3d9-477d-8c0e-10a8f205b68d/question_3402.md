# Q3402: Break reimbursement recoverability in generate_bitvm_pks_for_deposit

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with crafted the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context so `generate_bitvm_pks_for_deposit` moves the protocol past the point where reimbursement should remain recoverable, leaving the nofn aggregate key and covenant context inconsistent with the assumption that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, and leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/actor.rs::generate_bitvm_pks_for_deposit
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context
- Exploit idea: move bridge state forward while reimbursement/slashability stays tied to older state
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
