# Q1884: Leave reusable partial state in block_fetcher_task

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker force a partial failure around the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit` and then resume public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `block_fetcher_task` continues from stale intermediate state, causing the operator signature set attached to a deposit to diverge from the canonical bridge context and breaking the invariant that partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/states/task.rs::block_fetcher_task
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure around the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit` and then resume under changed state
- Invariant to test: partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
