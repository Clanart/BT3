# Q4741: calc-final-liquidation-amounts via liquidate-multi: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:834) — which recomputes debt proportionally when collateral was capped, a SECOND re-derivation after `process-debt-asset` already capped once — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:834` -> `calc-final-liquidation-amounts`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` recomputes debt proportionally when collateral was capped, a SECOND re-derivation after `process-debt-asset` already capped once. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, then read `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
