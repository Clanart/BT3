# Q449: Starknet ETH-signature domain state update before full validation through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public Starknet deploy/finalize entrypoints` with control over payload bytes, chain id fields embedded in payload, and signature `v/r/s` values and desynchronize `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token and fin_transfer signature path` from the adjacent proof parsing and source authentication that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `state update before full validation` attack class because recovers an Ethereum-style signer over raw Keccak of Borsh bytes rather than a structured Starknet domain separator, violating `signature bytes must stay uniquely bound to the intended Starknet action, chain context, and payload kind and must reject malleable variants`?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token and fin_transfer signature path`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet deploy/finalize entrypoints`
- Attacker controls: payload bytes, chain id fields embedded in payload, and signature `v/r/s` values
- Exploit idea: Look for `completed`, `finalised`, or bitmap writes that happen before every branch-specific validation step and external effect. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent proof parsing and source authentication.
- Invariant to test: signature bytes must stay uniquely bound to the intended Starknet action, chain context, and payload kind and must reject malleable variants
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force later validation or delivery to fail after replay state was consumed and assert that the transfer cannot be stranded or reopened inconsistently. Also assert cross-module consistency between `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token and fin_transfer signature path` and the adjacent proof parsing and source authentication after every branch.
