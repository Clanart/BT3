# Q3003: notify_roots flush-path service pinning

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_roots` by subscribe to roots and then drive hot slot/root movement with root subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot root movement so that a legal transaction/read pattern can force this path into a flush-heavy mode that blocks unrelated work, breaking the invariant that background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_roots
- Entrypoint: subscribe to roots and then drive hot slot/root movement
- Attacker controls: root subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot root movement
- Exploit idea: treat flush pressure as the resource
- Invariant to test: background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: run churn-heavy writes plus immediate reads and measure latency inflation
