# Q2681: Mix chunk order inside set_citrea_aggregate_finalized

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft the reveal-script chunk ordering and chunk sizes so `set_citrea_aggregate_finalized` keeps chunk ordering or chunk identity consistent in one place but not another, corrupting the commit outpoint tied to a Citrea raw-tx batch and violating the invariant that every chunk, aggregate body, commit outpoint, and reveal transaction must stay linked to the same Citrea payload, leading to Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/db/citrea.rs::set_citrea_aggregate_finalized
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_citrea_tx` request or a user-triggered Citrea commit/reveal automation path
- Attacker controls: the reveal-script chunk ordering and chunk sizes
- Exploit idea: keep chunk identity consistent in one place but not another using the reveal-script chunk ordering and chunk sizes
- Invariant to test: every chunk, aggregate body, commit outpoint, and reveal transaction must stay linked to the same Citrea payload
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that mutates chunk order, body hash, and commit-outpoint reuse across retries and assert no mixed commit/reveal state survives
