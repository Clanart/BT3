# Q3539: Drive state split inside verify_tar_image_digest_inspect_only

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation with crafted multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context so `verify_tar_image_digest_inspect_only` updates one canonical value while another subsystem retains the older one for the same event, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/docker.rs::verify_tar_image_digest_inspect_only
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: update one canonical value while another subsystem keeps the old one for the same event via multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
