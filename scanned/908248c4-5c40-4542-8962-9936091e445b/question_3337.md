# Q3337: Break reimbursement recoverability in internal_create_assert_commitment_txs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with crafted the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit` so `internal_create_assert_commitment_txs` moves the protocol past the point where reimbursement should remain recoverable, leaving the verifier nonce session that a final signature is supposed to consume inconsistent with the assumption that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, and leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/rpc/operator.rs::internal_create_assert_commitment_txs
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `old_move_txid` in `ReplacementDeposit`
- Exploit idea: move bridge state forward while reimbursement/slashability stays tied to older state
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
