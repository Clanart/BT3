# Q751: Backend.GetTransactionReceipt - Block Scoped Rebuild Disagrees With Indexer Lookup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker query protocol receipts or logs for crafted included Ethereum transactions through `eth_getTransactionReceipt by hash or block-scoped lookup` while controlling `ethTxIndex` and `tx result events`, under the precondition that the transaction failed, reverted, or exceeded block gas after fee charge, drive `block-scoped receipt rebuild -> TxResult lookup -> Cronos-controlled accounting consumer` in `rpc/backend/tx_info.go::Backend.GetTransactionReceipt` so that block-scoped rebuild disagrees with indexer lookup, violating the invariant that duplicate hashes or mixed messages must not overwrite receipt identity, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/backend/tx_info.go::Backend.GetTransactionReceipt`
- Entrypoint: `eth_getTransactionReceipt by hash or block-scoped lookup`
- Attacker controls: `ethTxIndex`, `tx result events`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: block-scoped rebuild disagrees with indexer lookup through `block-scoped receipt rebuild -> TxResult lookup -> Cronos-controlled accounting consumer`.
- Invariant to test: duplicate hashes or mixed messages must not overwrite receipt identity.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: force the edge value at uint64/uint256/sdk.Int boundaries and assert no smaller debit, larger refund, or supply change occurs.
