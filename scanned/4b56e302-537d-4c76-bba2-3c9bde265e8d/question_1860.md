# Q1860: Leave reusable partial state in txoutdb_encode_decode_invariant

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker force a partial failure around the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering and then resume public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `txoutdb_encode_decode_invariant` continues from stale intermediate state, causing the emergency-stop transaction that should protect the same deposit to diverge from the canonical bridge context and breaking the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/wrapper.rs::txoutdb_encode_decode_invariant
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure around the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering and then resume under changed state
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
