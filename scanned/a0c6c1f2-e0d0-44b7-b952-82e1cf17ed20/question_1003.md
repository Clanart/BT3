# Q1003: EVM transfer payload Borsh encoding state update before full validation via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public EVM `finTransfer` and `deployToken` signature paths` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol signed payload assembly` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `state update before full validation` under manually concatenates payload fields before Keccak and ECDSA recovery, violating `manual payload assembly must not admit alternative byte layouts that verify the same signature for materially different bridge actions`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol signed payload assembly`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM `finTransfer` and `deployToken` signature paths`
- Attacker controls: all fields concatenated into Borsh-encoded bytes including optional fee-recipient and message bytes
- Exploit idea: Look for `completed`, `finalised`, or bitmap writes that happen before every branch-specific validation step and external effect. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: manual payload assembly must not admit alternative byte layouts that verify the same signature for materially different bridge actions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force later validation or delivery to fail after replay state was consumed and assert that the transfer cannot be stranded or reopened inconsistently. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
