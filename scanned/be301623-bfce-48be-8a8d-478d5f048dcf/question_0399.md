# Q399: sendTransaction downstream queue coupling

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `sendTransaction` within the single-client low-rate model and choose serialized transaction bytes, versioned messages, address lookup tables, compute-budget instructions, account metas, signatures, and preflight flags such that `send_transaction` triggers a path where one request here triggers enough downstream work to inflate unrelated queues or watchers, violating the invariant that one request should not explode unrelated internal work queues and causing `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc.rs::send_transaction
- Entrypoint: JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from a single unauthenticated client at no more than once per `CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET / 2`
- Attacker controls: serialized transaction bytes, versioned messages, address lookup tables, compute-budget instructions, account metas, signatures, and preflight flags
- Exploit idea: trace the queues behind the API, not just the immediate method body
- Invariant to test: one request should not explode unrelated internal work queues
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: instrument downstream queue lengths while replaying one heavy call shape
