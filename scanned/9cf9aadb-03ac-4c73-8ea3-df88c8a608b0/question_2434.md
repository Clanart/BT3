# Q2434: destroy: A `return_address` after logout reflecting attacker `shop`/`hos...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`shop`, `host`, the OAuth state cookie) reach `destroy / redirect_to_begin_oauth cookie` in app/controllers/shopify_app/sessions_controller.rb via GET /logout and the OAuth begin cookie set, supplying a `return_address` after logout reflecting attacker `shop`/`host` params, so that OAuth state/nonce must be unpredictable and bound to this browser only is violated, leading to OAuth CSRF / authorization-code interception (account takeover, not plain logout CSRF)? Specifically confirm that the error/rescue branch fails closed and leaks no token or secret.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/sessions_controller.rb — `destroy / redirect_to_begin_oauth cookie`
- Entrypoint: GET /logout and the OAuth begin cookie set
- Attacker controls: `shop`, `host`, the OAuth state cookie — specifically a `return_address` after logout reflecting attacker `shop`/`host` params.
- Exploit idea: Force the rescued/exception branch and confirm it fails closed without leaking secrets or granting a session.
- Invariant to test: OAuth state/nonce must be unpredictable and bound to this browser only
- Expected Immunefi impact: OAuth CSRF / authorization-code interception (account takeover, not plain logout CSRF) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: error-injection test asserting the rescue branch yields no session, no token, and no secret in the response/log.
