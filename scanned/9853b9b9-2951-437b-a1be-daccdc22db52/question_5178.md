# Q5178: WombatBribeManager.claimBribe - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `claimBribe(address[] lps)` under the attacker passes the same lp address several times in one array and force `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` apart from `totalVlMgpInVote`, breaking the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates for Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `claimBribe(address[] lps)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `claimBribe(address[] lps)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the lp array and the settlement timing
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the attacker passes the same lp address several times in one array.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` must stay reconciled with `totalVlMgpInVote`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `claimBribe(address[] lps)` sequence atomically under the attacker passes the same lp address several times in one array, asserting at the end that `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` still equals `totalVlMgpInVote` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
