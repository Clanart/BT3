# Q958: load_and_execute_transactions late-failure leakage

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_and_execute_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with versioned messages, alt-heavy account sets, cpi depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets such that transactions that fail very late after touching many accounts can leak partial side effects into caches, logs, or counters observed later, breaking the invariant that late failures must roll back every consensus-relevant state effect and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::load_and_execute_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, ALT-heavy account sets, CPI depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: force the failure point as late as possible
- Invariant to test: late failures must roll back every consensus-relevant state effect
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: create deep CPI graphs that fail at the end and diff every derived cache/counter afterward
