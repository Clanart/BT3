# Q4552: resolve-or-create via collateral-remove-redeem: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
