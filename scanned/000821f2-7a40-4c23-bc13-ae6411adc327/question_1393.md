# Q1393: get-bitmap via collateral-remove: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, drive `get-bitmap` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145) — which returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145` -> `get-bitmap`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `get-bitmap` returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, then read `get-bitmap` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
