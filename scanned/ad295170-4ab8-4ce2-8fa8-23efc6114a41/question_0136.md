# Q0136: WombatPoolHelperV2.deposit - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, where none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Assuming the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `pid cached at construction` and `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, breaking the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard and producing Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity) under the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, asserting on every row that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard.
