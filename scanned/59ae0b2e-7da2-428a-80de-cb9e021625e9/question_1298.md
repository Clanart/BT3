# Q1298: NEAR relayer fast-claim coupling recipient or fee-recipient rebinding at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public `claim_fee` plus earlier fast-finalization path` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee_callback with fast-transfer origin ids` violate `the first leg and second leg of a fast transfer must stay tightly coupled so a relayer cannot claim against a different transfer or a different fee schedule` in the `recipient or fee-recipient rebinding` attack class because uses `origin_transfer_id` to ensure that a relayer who fronted a fast transfer can only collect fee after the origin leg really finalizes with matching parameters becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee_callback with fast-transfer origin ids`
- Entrypoint: `public `claim_fee` plus earlier fast-finalization path`
- Attacker controls: fast-transfer id, origin transfer id, relayer identity, fee recipient, and settlement order across both legs
- Exploit idea: Exploit optional fee-recipient fields, fast-transfer relayer substitution, or predecessor-captured identities. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: the first leg and second leg of a fast transfer must stay tightly coupled so a relayer cannot claim against a different transfer or a different fee schedule
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Build pairs of proofs/messages that vary only in recipient-oriented fields and assert that settlement, fee claim, and event emission stay bound to one tuple. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
