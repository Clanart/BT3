# Q1018: NEAR claim_fee entry recipient or fee-recipient rebinding through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public `claim_fee` proof-submission flow` with control over proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and caller identity as purported fee recipient and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `recipient or fee-recipient rebinding` attack class because verifies a `FinTransfer` proof and forwards the predecessor account into `claim_fee_callback` for fee release, violating `fee claims must remain uniquely bound to one already-finalized destination event and one authentic fee recipient`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee`
- Entrypoint: `public `claim_fee` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and caller identity as purported fee recipient
- Exploit idea: Exploit optional fee-recipient fields, fast-transfer relayer substitution, or predecessor-captured identities. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: fee claims must remain uniquely bound to one already-finalized destination event and one authentic fee recipient
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Build pairs of proofs/messages that vary only in recipient-oriented fields and assert that settlement, fee claim, and event emission stay bound to one tuple. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
