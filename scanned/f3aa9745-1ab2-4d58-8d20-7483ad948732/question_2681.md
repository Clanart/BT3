# Q2681: remove same-pubkey churn hotspot

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads during account churn with read-after-delete and recreate patterns against the same accounts so that rewriting one pubkey repeatedly creates pathological behavior that normal multi-pubkey load does not, breaking the invariant that hot-key churn should not create correctness or performance pathologies and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs::remove
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads during account churn
- Attacker controls: read-after-delete and recreate patterns against the same accounts
- Exploit idea: use hot-key churn rather than broad fanout
- Invariant to test: hot-key churn should not create correctness or performance pathologies
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: compare same-pubkey rewrite churn against equally large multi-pubkey churn
