# Q2244: Duplicate queue or processing state in save_cancelled_txid

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `save_cancelled_txid` twice with attacker-controlled the `activate_outpoints` / `activate_txids` dependency lists but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the finalized/seen-at-height status recorded for the send request and violating the invariant that RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent, leading to Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/db/tx_sender.rs::save_cancelled_txid
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `activate_outpoints` / `activate_txids` dependency lists
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the `activate_outpoints` / `activate_txids` dependency lists
- Invariant to test: RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
