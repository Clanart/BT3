# Q0653: BaseRewardPool.getReward - _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles

## Question
In rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol, _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` while the pool has exactly one registered reward token and no queued backlog, and drive `rewards[_rewardToken].queuedRewards` out of agreement with `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` - breaking the invariant that a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered - for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the timing of the claim, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Precondition: the pool has exactly one registered reward token and no queued backlog.
- Invariant to test: a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].queuedRewards` must stay reconciled with `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the pool has exactly one registered reward token and no queued backlog, then assert `rewards[_rewardToken].queuedRewards` and `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` end identical in both runs.
