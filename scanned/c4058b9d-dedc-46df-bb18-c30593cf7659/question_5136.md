# Q5136: WombatBribeManager.voteAndCast - getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown

## Question
In wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Starting from a state where the attacker passes the same lp address several times in one array, can an unprivileged EOA use `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)` to leave `userTotalVotedInVlmgp[msg.sender]` inconsistent with `IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(msg.sender)`, violating the invariant that the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance and extracting Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)` (mechanism: getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the deltas and the atomic vote-then-cast ordering inside one transaction
- Exploit idea: getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Precondition: the attacker passes the same lp address several times in one array.
- Invariant to test: the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance; concretely, `userTotalVotedInVlmgp[msg.sender]` must stay reconciled with `IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(msg.sender)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the attacker passes the same lp address several times in one array, have the attacker run `voteAndCast(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas, bool swapForBnb)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `userTotalVotedInVlmgp[msg.sender]` versus `IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(msg.sender)` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
