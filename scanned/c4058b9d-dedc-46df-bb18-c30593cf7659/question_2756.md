# Q2756: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.depositNative - safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie

## Question
In wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Starting from a state where the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, can an unprivileged EOA use `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` to leave `pid cached at construction` inconsistent with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, violating the invariant that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent and extracting High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Precondition: the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg.
- Invariant to test: an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (msg.value and _minimumLiquidity) under the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, asserting on every row that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent.
