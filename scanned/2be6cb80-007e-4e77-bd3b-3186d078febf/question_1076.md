# Q1076: population via borrow: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it counts set bits to order the bucket search, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `borrow` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `population` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
