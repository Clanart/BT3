# Q3274: debt-remove-scaled via repay: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `repay` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
