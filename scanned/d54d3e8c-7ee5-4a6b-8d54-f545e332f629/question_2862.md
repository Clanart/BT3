# Q2862: VLMGP.startUnlock - forceUnLock never refreshes the referral boost factor

## Question
Consider VLMGP.sol, where startUnlock() and _lock() both call IReferralStorage(referralStorage).updateTotalFactor(), but forceUnLock(), unlock() and cancelUnlock() do not, so userInfos[user].factor and the shared totalBoostFactor denominator drift away from the real getUserTotalLocked. Assuming the pool the attacker voted for has since been deactivated so unvote reverts, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `getUserAmountInCoolDown(user)` and `totalAmountInCoolDown` via `startUnlock(uint256 _amountToCoolDown)`, breaking the invariant that the referral boost factor and its global denominator must be refreshed on every path that changes a user's locked balance and producing High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: VLMGP.sol -> `startUnlock(uint256 _amountToCoolDown)` (mechanism: forceUnLock never refreshes the referral boost factor)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `startUnlock(uint256 _amountToCoolDown)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountToCoolDown and the timestamp that fixes startTime/endTime for the slot
- Exploit idea: startUnlock() and _lock() both call IReferralStorage(referralStorage).updateTotalFactor(), but forceUnLock(), unlock() and cancelUnlock() do not, so userInfos[user].factor and the shared totalBoostFactor denominator drift away from the real getUserTotalLocked. Precondition: the pool the attacker voted for has since been deactivated so unvote reverts.
- Invariant to test: the referral boost factor and its global denominator must be refreshed on every path that changes a user's locked balance; concretely, `getUserAmountInCoolDown(user)` must stay reconciled with `totalAmountInCoolDown`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amountToCoolDown and the timestamp that fixes startTime/endTime for the slot) under the pool the attacker voted for has since been deactivated so unvote reverts, asserting on every row that the referral boost factor and its global denominator must be refreshed on every path that changes a user's locked balance.
