# Q0022: ArbitrumMWomAirdrop.claim - claimedAmount is keyed by account but the entitlement is keyed by leaf

## Question
In rewards/ArbitrumMWomAirdrop.sol, claimedAmount[account] is a single counter while _getClaimable is parameterised by the totalAmount carried in the proof, so an account that appears in the tree under more than one amount shares one counter across two different entitlements. Does `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the account appears in the merkle tree under two different totalAmount values, so that `claimedAmount[account]` diverges from `totalAmount proven by the merkle leaf`, the invariant that the claimed counter must be scoped to the exact leaf that authorised the entitlement is broken, and the result is Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/ArbitrumMWomAirdrop.sol -> `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)` (mechanism: claimedAmount is keyed by account but the entitlement is keyed by leaf)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: totalAmount and merkleProof for any leaf that verifies against the root, plus isLock and the claim timing
- Exploit idea: claimedAmount[account] is a single counter while _getClaimable is parameterised by the totalAmount carried in the proof, so an account that appears in the tree under more than one amount shares one counter across two different entitlements. Precondition: the account appears in the merkle tree under two different totalAmount values.
- Invariant to test: the claimed counter must be scoped to the exact leaf that authorised the entitlement; concretely, `claimedAmount[account]` must stay reconciled with `totalAmount proven by the merkle leaf`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the account appears in the merkle tree under two different totalAmount values, snapshot `claimedAmount[account]` and `totalAmount proven by the merkle leaf`, run the attacker's `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
