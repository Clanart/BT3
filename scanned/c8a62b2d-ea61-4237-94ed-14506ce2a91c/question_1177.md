# Q1177: NEAR fin_transfer callback recipient or fee-recipient rebinding at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `proof callback reached from public `fin_transfer`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fin_transfer_callback` violate `the validated source transfer, denormalized value, and chosen destination branch must remain bound to the same origin event throughout settlement` in the `recipient or fee-recipient rebinding` attack class because decodes `ProverResult::InitTransfer`, checks the factory mapping, denormalizes amount and fee, allocates a new destination nonce, and routes to Near or non-Near settlement becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fin_transfer_callback`
- Entrypoint: `proof callback reached from public `fin_transfer``
- Attacker controls: decoded prover result, origin chain, token mapping, decimals, storage-deposit action order, and recipient chain
- Exploit idea: Exploit optional fee-recipient fields, fast-transfer relayer substitution, or predecessor-captured identities. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: the validated source transfer, denormalized value, and chosen destination branch must remain bound to the same origin event throughout settlement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Build pairs of proofs/messages that vary only in recipient-oriented fields and assert that settlement, fee claim, and event emission stay bound to one tuple. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
