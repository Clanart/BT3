# Q2736: Confuse confirmation/finalization tracking in calculate_target_fee_rate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit timing around the `tx_metadata` fields attached to the queued send request so `calculate_target_fee_rate` records a confirmation/finalization view that diverges from the actual chain state, corrupting the cancel/activate dependency graph persisted in the database and breaking the invariant that queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/lib.rs::calculate_target_fee_rate
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `tx_metadata` fields attached to the queued send request
- Exploit idea: diverge chain-observation state from persisted send state using the `tx_metadata` fields attached to the queued send request
- Invariant to test: queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
