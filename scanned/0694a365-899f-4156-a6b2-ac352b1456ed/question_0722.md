# Q722: Exploit reorg boundary handling in assert_single_op_return_commitment_outputs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit reorg timing around the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof so `assert_single_op_return_commitment_outputs` treats a non-canonical object as canonical long enough to mutate bridge state, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and violating the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/bridge_circuit_host.rs::assert_single_op_return_commitment_outputs
- Entrypoint: broadcast a crafted Bitcoin kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transaction that later reaches sync and verifier logic
- Attacker controls: the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Exploit idea: reorder or replay the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof across canonical and non-canonical views
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
