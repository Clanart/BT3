# Q250: Solana init_transfer_sol origin and destination nonce desynchronization via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Solana `init_transfer_sol` instruction` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_sol` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `origin and destination nonce desynchronization` under handles outbound native-SOL bridging while still posting the same class of Near-bound transfer payload, violating `native-SOL outbound flows must not emit claims whose amount or fee exceeds the value actually escrowing or burning on Solana`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_sol`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `init_transfer_sol` instruction`
- Attacker controls: payer lamports, recipient string, amount, fee, native fee, and message
- Exploit idea: Drive retries, resume paths, or recursive bridge legs until one deposit appears under more than one transfer identity. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: native-SOL outbound flows must not emit claims whose amount or fee exceeds the value actually escrowing or burning on Solana
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trace every nonce mutation site and fuzz repeated calls plus reordered callbacks to prove that one deposit cannot create two valid transfer ids or destination messages. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
