# Q2355: EVM Wormhole initTransferExtension resume-path replay or duplication through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public outbound flow through `initTransfer` on Wormhole-backed chains` with control over msg.value passed as `value`, current `wormholeNonce`, sender, token address, origin nonce, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, and message and desynchronize `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::initTransferExtension` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `resume-path replay or duplication` attack class because serializes a Wormhole `InitTransfer` payload and publishes it using the current nonce and supplied value, violating `outbound message publication must remain one-to-one with consumed assets and must not diverge under underpayment, overpayment, or callback/retry edge cases`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::initTransferExtension`
- Entrypoint: `public outbound flow through `initTransfer` on Wormhole-backed chains`
- Attacker controls: msg.value passed as `value`, current `wormholeNonce`, sender, token address, origin nonce, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, and message
- Exploit idea: Abuse yield/resume or asynchronous callback timing so the same pending outbound transfer is restarted after it already progressed. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: outbound message publication must remain one-to-one with consumed assets and must not diverge under underpayment, overpayment, or callback/retry edge cases
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trigger timeouts, duplicate funding, and repeated callback delivery and assert that the resumed transfer either progresses once or cleanly fails once. Also assert cross-module consistency between `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::initTransferExtension` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
