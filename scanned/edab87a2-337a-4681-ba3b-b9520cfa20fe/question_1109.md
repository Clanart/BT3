# Q1109: status-multi via collateral-remove: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the set of assets held, drive `status-multi` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:163) — which calls `(map unwrap-status ids mask)` as a TWO-LIST map where `mask` is `uint-to-list-u64` of the bitmap, pairing each id positionally and truncating to the shorter list — to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:163` -> `status-multi`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `status-multi` calls `(map unwrap-status ids mask)` as a TWO-LIST map where `mask` is `uint-to-list-u64` of the bitmap, pairing each id positionally and truncating to the shorter list. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the set of assets held, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
