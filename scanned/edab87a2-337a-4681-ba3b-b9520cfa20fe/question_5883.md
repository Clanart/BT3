# Q5883: interest-rate via borrow: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `borrow` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `interest-rate` touches, run `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
