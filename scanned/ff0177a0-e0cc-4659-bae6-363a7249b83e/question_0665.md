# Q0665: ManualCompound.compound - locker branch sends the whole balance to msg.sender

## Question
rewards/ManualCompound.sol: when _locker is configured and _lockMgp is true, ILocker(_locker).lockFor(receivedBalance, msg.sender) locks the contract's entire balance of that token for the caller. Under another user's multiclaimOnBehalf is pending in the mempool and will land in the same block, is there an unprivileged sequence of `compound(address[] _lps, address[][] _rewards, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, bool _lockMgp)` that leaves `_convertRatio supplied by the caller` unreconciled with `the value being converted for other users`, violates the invariant that a locking branch must lock only the caller's own earned amount, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/ManualCompound.sol -> `compound(address[] _lps, address[][] _rewards, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, bool _lockMgp)` (mechanism: locker branch sends the whole balance to msg.sender)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `compound(address[] _lps, address[][] _rewards, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, bool _lockMgp)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: every element of _lps and _rewards, plus _convertRatio, _minRec and _lockMgp, with no restriction on who calls
- Exploit idea: when _locker is configured and _lockMgp is true, ILocker(_locker).lockFor(receivedBalance, msg.sender) locks the contract's entire balance of that token for the caller. Precondition: another user's multiclaimOnBehalf is pending in the mempool and will land in the same block.
- Invariant to test: a locking branch must lock only the caller's own earned amount; concretely, `_convertRatio supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the value being converted for other users`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up another user's multiclaimOnBehalf is pending in the mempool and will land in the same block, snapshot `_convertRatio supplied by the caller` and `the value being converted for other users`, run the attacker's `compound(address[] _lps, address[][] _rewards, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, bool _lockMgp)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
