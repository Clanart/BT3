# Q1934: store_modified_entry program-cache staleness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store_modified_entry` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs around upgrade/close churn with upgrade timing, close/reopen timing, and repeated invocation of the same program id such that upgrade, close, or deploy timing makes this function observe a stale executor or stale deployment slot state, breaking the invariant that program cache contents must match loader-visible deployment state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/loaded_programs.rs::store_modified_entry
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs around upgrade/close churn
- Attacker controls: upgrade timing, close/reopen timing, and repeated invocation of the same program id
- Exploit idea: look for old-code/new-state or new-code/old-state combinations
- Invariant to test: program cache contents must match loader-visible deployment state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race loader upgrades or closes against repeated invocations
