# Q1654: price-multi-resolve via liquidate-redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, can an unprivileged attacker make `price-multi-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `price-multi-resolve` folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397` -> `price-multi-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `price-multi-resolve` folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
