# Q3380: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.withdraw - burnReceiptToken is the last step and is not atomic with the payout

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol: withdraw() pays out, then unstakes, then calls IWombatStaking(wombatStaking).burnReceiptToken, so between the payout and the burn the receipt-token supply still claims backing that has already left. With _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check under attacker control and a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, can an unprivileged caller sequence `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` so that `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` and `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that receipt supply must fall in the same step as the backing it represents and realising Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: burnReceiptToken is the last step and is not atomic with the payout)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check
- Exploit idea: withdraw() pays out, then unstakes, then calls IWombatStaking(wombatStaking).burnReceiptToken, so between the payout and the burn the receipt-token supply still claims backing that has already left. Precondition: a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper.
- Invariant to test: receipt supply must fall in the same step as the backing it represents; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, have the attacker run `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` versus `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
