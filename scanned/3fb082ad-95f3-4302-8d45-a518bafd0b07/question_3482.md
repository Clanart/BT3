# Q3482: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.withdraw - the lockedAmount restriction is enforced only inside this helper

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol: withdraw() checks unlockTime and lockedAmount[msg.sender] against this.balance(msg.sender) after unstaking, but the underlying position is ordinary MasterMagpie stake in the same stakingToken, so the restriction is only as strong as this one code path. With _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check under attacker control and a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, can an unprivileged caller sequence `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` so that `this.balance(msg.sender)` and `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a time restriction on a position must be enforced where the position lives, not in one optional front-end contract and realising Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: the lockedAmount restriction is enforced only inside this helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check
- Exploit idea: withdraw() checks unlockTime and lockedAmount[msg.sender] against this.balance(msg.sender) after unstaking, but the underlying position is ordinary MasterMagpie stake in the same stakingToken, so the restriction is only as strong as this one code path. Precondition: a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper.
- Invariant to test: a time restriction on a position must be enforced where the position lives, not in one optional front-end contract; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, have the attacker run `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `this.balance(msg.sender)` versus `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
