# Q3967: StateDB.SubBalance - Subtraction From Missing Account Creates Negative Accounting State

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker execute a contract that moves EVM-denom value through nested calls through `EVM balance debit for CALL value, gas buy, or selfdestruct burn` while controlling `bank balance` and `CALL value`, under the precondition that the target account is created and destroyed in the same transaction, drive `EVM CALL/SELFDESTRUCT -> StateDB native cache -> RevertToSnapshot -> Commit` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.SubBalance` so that subtraction from missing account creates negative accounting state, violating the invariant that SELFDESTRUCT must not leave withdrawable balances in deleted accounts, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.SubBalance`
- Entrypoint: `EVM balance debit for CALL value, gas buy, or selfdestruct burn`
- Attacker controls: `bank balance`, `CALL value`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: subtraction from missing account creates negative accounting state through `EVM CALL/SELFDESTRUCT -> StateDB native cache -> RevertToSnapshot -> Commit`.
- Invariant to test: SELFDESTRUCT must not leave withdrawable balances in deleted accounts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: force the edge value at uint64/uint256/sdk.Int boundaries and assert no smaller debit, larger refund, or supply change occurs.
