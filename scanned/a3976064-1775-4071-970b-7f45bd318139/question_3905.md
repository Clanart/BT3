# Q3905: merge-price via collateral-add: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling `amount`, drive `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) — which attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
