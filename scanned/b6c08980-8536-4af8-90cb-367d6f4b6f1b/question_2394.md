# Q2394: flush_accounts_cache stale cache replay

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `flush_accounts_cache` by submit transactions that touch many writable accounts and then query them immediately with many-account write bursts, slot churn, and immediate read-after-write rpcs so that stale cached account content can outlive the storage or bank state that later logic expects, breaking the invariant that caches must not serve account data from an impossible slot/state combination and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::flush_accounts_cache
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that touch many writable accounts and then query them immediately
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts, slot churn, and immediate read-after-write RPCs
- Exploit idea: read an impossible old value after the canonical state has changed
- Invariant to test: caches must not serve account data from an impossible slot/state combination
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race rewrites and immediate reads, then diff cache-derived results against storage and bank views
