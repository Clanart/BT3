# Q1384: stream mis-bind attacker-controlled bytes to trusted state via macro-generated vector fields

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker round-trip macro-generated protocol objects targeting `stream` in `crates/chia-traits/src/streamable.rs` with macro-generated vector fields when the attacker can choose ordering inside a batch make chia_rs mis-bind attacker-controlled bytes to trusted state, violating the invariant that trusted parse mode is not exposed to attacker-controlled non-canonical bytes, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-traits/src/streamable.rs:277` / `stream`
- Entrypoint: round-trip macro-generated protocol objects
- Attacker controls: macro-generated vector fields
- Exploit idea: Drive `stream` through its public caller path using macro-generated vector fields; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: trusted parse mode is not exposed to attacker-controlled non-canonical bytes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption
- Fast validation: expand the macro on a representative struct and mutate each field in serialized bytes.
