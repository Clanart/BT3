# Q2768: load_latest valid-input crash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_latest` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads for hot accounts under continuous rewrites with same-pubkey rewrites across slots with immediate reads so that validly encoded account/notification state or subscription flow can still reach a panic or abort, breaking the invariant that valid inputs and valid subscription flows must not crash this path and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::load_latest
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads for hot accounts under continuous rewrites
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey rewrites across slots with immediate reads
- Exploit idea: treat state-filtering and watcher code as crash surfaces
- Invariant to test: valid inputs and valid subscription flows must not crash this path
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: fuzz only valid subscription parameters and event payload shapes while monitoring for crashes
