# Q2968: notify_signatures_received valid-input crash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_signatures_received` by subscribe to signatures and then submit many status-changing transactions with signature subscriptions, duplicate-signature churn, and slow consumer behavior so that validly encoded account/notification state or subscription flow can still reach a panic or abort, breaking the invariant that valid inputs and valid subscription flows must not crash this path and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_signatures_received
- Entrypoint: subscribe to signatures and then submit many status-changing transactions
- Attacker controls: signature subscriptions, duplicate-signature churn, and slow consumer behavior
- Exploit idea: treat state-filtering and watcher code as crash surfaces
- Invariant to test: valid inputs and valid subscription flows must not crash this path
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: fuzz only valid subscription parameters and event payload shapes while monitoring for crashes
