# Q1379: parse allow replay across contexts via JSON dictionary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker compute streamable hashes targeting `parse` in `crates/chia-traits/src/streamable.rs` with JSON dictionary values when the attacker can choose ordering inside a batch make chia_rs allow replay across contexts, violating the invariant that hashes commit to vector lengths and enum discriminants, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-traits/src/streamable.rs:244` / `parse`
- Entrypoint: compute streamable hashes
- Attacker controls: JSON dictionary values
- Exploit idea: Drive `parse` through its public caller path using JSON dictionary values; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: hashes commit to vector lengths and enum discriminants
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data
- Fast validation: assert trusted parse is only used after a canonical parse boundary.
