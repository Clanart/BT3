# Q2486: generate_index notification filter overload

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `generate_index` by submit transactions that create many attacker-controlled accounts with structured keys with many-account creation with common owners/layouts and repeated indexed reads so that attacker-chosen notification filters force more post-filter work than the subscriber semantics imply, breaking the invariant that notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::generate_index
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that create many attacker-controlled accounts with structured keys
- Attacker controls: many-account creation with common owners/layouts and repeated indexed reads
- Exploit idea: use valid subscription filters as the amplifier
- Invariant to test: notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: compare pre-filter candidate counts to delivered-notification counts
