# Q2150: Substitute a wrong proof path into serialize_txout

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker substitute part of attacker-controlled the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof so `serialize_txout` accepts a proof, header, or path that should have been rejected, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/structs.rs::serialize_txout
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Exploit idea: swap part of attacker-controlled the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof while keeping the rest seemingly valid
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
