# Q3757: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.depositNative - receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary

## Question
Note that in wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` under the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes and force `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` apart from `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, breaking the invariant that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution for Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Precondition: the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes.
- Invariant to test: the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`: constrain the setup so that the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, fuzz the attacker inputs (msg.value and _minimumLiquidity), and assert after every call that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution.
