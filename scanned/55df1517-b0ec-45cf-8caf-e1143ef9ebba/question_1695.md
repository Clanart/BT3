# Q1695: Exploit witness/annex edge cases in work_only_circuit

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit witness, annex, or script-path edge cases in the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values so `work_only_circuit` verifies a different Bitcoin statement than later settlement relies on, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and violating the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/work_only/mod.rs::work_only_circuit
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Exploit idea: make verification hash a different Bitcoin statement than settlement later uses via the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
