# Q3988: mWOM.convert - _convert transfers WOM before the veWOM lock is confirmed

## Question
wombat/mWOM.sol: for the _doConvert path, _convert() sends the WOM to wombatStaking and then calls _lockWom, so the WOM is out of this contract's control before the lock result is known and any third party call to convertAllWom in between changes the attribution. With _amount, and the block relative to any pending convertAllWom under attacker control and helper is unset so convertAndStake reverts and only the plain mint path is reachable, can an unprivileged caller sequence `convert(uint256 _amount)` so that `IERC20(this).totalSupply()` and `IERC20(wom).balanceOf(wombatStaking) + veWom backing` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that value must not leave the accounting contract before the step that accounts for it has completed and realising Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWOM.sol -> `convert(uint256 _amount)` (mechanism: _convert transfers WOM before the veWOM lock is confirmed)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `convert(uint256 _amount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, and the block relative to any pending convertAllWom
- Exploit idea: for the _doConvert path, _convert() sends the WOM to wombatStaking and then calls _lockWom, so the WOM is out of this contract's control before the lock result is known and any third party call to convertAllWom in between changes the attribution. Precondition: helper is unset so convertAndStake reverts and only the plain mint path is reachable.
- Invariant to test: value must not leave the accounting contract before the step that accounts for it has completed; concretely, `IERC20(this).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(wom).balanceOf(wombatStaking) + veWom backing`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under helper is unset so convertAndStake reverts and only the plain mint path is reachable, then assert `IERC20(this).totalSupply()` and `IERC20(wom).balanceOf(wombatStaking) + veWom backing` end identical in both runs.
