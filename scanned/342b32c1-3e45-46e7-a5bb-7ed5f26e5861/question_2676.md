# Q2676: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.depositLP - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Under the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, is there an unprivileged sequence of `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` that leaves `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` unreconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`, violates the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, call `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`, and assert `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` equals `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
