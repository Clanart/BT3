# Q1564: mWOM.convert - _convert transfers WOM before the veWOM lock is confirmed

## Question
wombat/mWOM.sol: for the _doConvert path, _convert() sends the WOM to wombatStaking and then calls _lockWom, so the WOM is out of this contract's control before the lock result is known and any third party call to convertAllWom in between changes the attribution. With _amount, and the block relative to any pending convertAllWom under attacker control and an owner funding transfer of MGP is sitting in the mempool, can an unprivileged caller sequence `convert(uint256 _amount)` so that `_amount minted as mWOM` and `mintedVeWomAmount returned by IWombatStaking.convertWOM` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that value must not leave the accounting contract before the step that accounts for it has completed and realising Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWOM.sol -> `convert(uint256 _amount)` (mechanism: _convert transfers WOM before the veWOM lock is confirmed)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `convert(uint256 _amount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, and the block relative to any pending convertAllWom
- Exploit idea: for the _doConvert path, _convert() sends the WOM to wombatStaking and then calls _lockWom, so the WOM is out of this contract's control before the lock result is known and any third party call to convertAllWom in between changes the attribution. Precondition: an owner funding transfer of MGP is sitting in the mempool.
- Invariant to test: value must not leave the accounting contract before the step that accounts for it has completed; concretely, `_amount minted as mWOM` must stay reconciled with `mintedVeWomAmount returned by IWombatStaking.convertWOM`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under an owner funding transfer of MGP is sitting in the mempool, then assert `_amount minted as mWOM` and `mintedVeWomAmount returned by IWombatStaking.convertWOM` end identical in both runs.
