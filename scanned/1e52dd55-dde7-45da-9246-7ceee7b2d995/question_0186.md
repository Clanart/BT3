# Q0186: principal-ratio-reduction via redeem: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `amount` of shares burned, can an unprivileged attacker make `principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `redeem` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` of shares burned across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `principal-ratio-reduction` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
