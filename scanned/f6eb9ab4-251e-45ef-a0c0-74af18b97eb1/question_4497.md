# Q4497: get-full-position via collateral-remove: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), drive `get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) — which returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-full-position` touches, run `collateral-remove` with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
