# Q862: NEAR process_fin_transfer_to_near asset-branch confusion on finalization via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `internal path reached from public `fin_transfer`` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::process_fin_transfer_to_near` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `asset-branch confusion on finalization` under marks the transfer finalised, optionally redirects payout to the fast-transfer relayer, checks storage-deposit actions for recipient and fee recipients, unlocks tokens, sends tokens, and mints fee tokens in the callback, violating `Near-side finalization must never misroute recipient funds, fee funds, or lock state across storage setup, fast-transfer substitution, and callback resolution`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::process_fin_transfer_to_near`
- Entrypoint: `internal path reached from public `fin_transfer``
- Attacker controls: recipient account, predecessor account, transfer message, storage-deposit actions, fast-transfer status, and lock actions
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: Near-side finalization must never misroute recipient funds, fee funds, or lock state across storage setup, fast-transfer substitution, and callback resolution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
