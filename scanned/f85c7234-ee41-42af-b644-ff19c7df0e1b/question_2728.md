# Q2728: accounts_cache.load flush-path service pinning

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by submit transactions plus immediate reads for recently changed accounts with same-pubkey churn plus immediate readback so that a legal transaction/read pattern can force this path into a flush-heavy mode that blocks unrelated work, breaking the invariant that background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::load
- Entrypoint: submit transactions plus immediate reads for recently changed accounts
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey churn plus immediate readback
- Exploit idea: treat flush pressure as the resource
- Invariant to test: background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: run churn-heavy writes plus immediate reads and measure latency inflation
