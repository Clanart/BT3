# Q1529: check_fee_payer_unlocked program-deployment race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `check_fee_payer_unlocked` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with fee-payer aliases, duplicate accounts, rent edge cases, and batch ordering such that loader state and runtime state can disagree about whether a program version is executable when this function runs, breaking the invariant that program executability must be consistent across loader and runtime checks and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/banking_stage/consumer.rs::check_fee_payer_unlocked
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: fee-payer aliases, duplicate accounts, rent edge cases, and batch ordering
- Exploit idea: look for invocation windows around deploy/upgrade/close boundaries
- Invariant to test: program executability must be consistent across loader and runtime checks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race upgrade/close transactions against repeated invocation of the same program id
