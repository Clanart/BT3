# Q2974: notify_vote cleanup drops live state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_vote` by subscribe to votes and then drive hot transaction flow that affects vote visibility with vote subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot notification streams so that cleanup or compaction can discard still-live attacker-controlled account state, breaking the invariant that live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_vote
- Entrypoint: subscribe to votes and then drive hot transaction flow that affects vote visibility
- Attacker controls: vote subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot notification streams
- Exploit idea: look for mistaken liveness decisions under fast churn
- Invariant to test: live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn many attacker-owned accounts through close/recreate/update cycles
