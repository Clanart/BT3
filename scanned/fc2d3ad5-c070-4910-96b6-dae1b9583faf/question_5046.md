# Q5046: SmartWomConvert.smartConvert - shared mWOM balance is settled to whoever calls next

## Question
wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol - mode 1 and mode 2 approve and forward obtainedmWomAmount out of the contract's own balance rather than out of a per-user ledger, so mWOM stranded in this contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to the next caller. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _amountIn and _mode, plus the pool state that currentRatio and maxSwapAmount are read from, under the router leaves a non-zero allowance after the swap, exploit this through `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` to break the reconciliation between `_minRec` and `convertAmount + amountRec` and the invariant that one caller must never be settled out of value another caller left behind, yielding Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol -> `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: shared mWOM balance is settled to whoever calls next)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountIn and _mode, plus the pool state that currentRatio and maxSwapAmount are read from
- Exploit idea: mode 1 and mode 2 approve and forward obtainedmWomAmount out of the contract's own balance rather than out of a per-user ledger, so mWOM stranded in this contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to the next caller. Precondition: the router leaves a non-zero allowance after the swap.
- Invariant to test: one caller must never be settled out of value another caller left behind; concretely, `_minRec` must stay reconciled with `convertAmount + amountRec`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` sequence atomically under the router leaves a non-zero allowance after the swap, asserting at the end that `_minRec` still equals `convertAmount + amountRec` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
