# Q0820: ManualCompound.compound - rewards array iterated for every caller regardless of what they claimed

## Question
rewards/ManualCompound.sol: the second loop iterates the full rewards array on every call, so every configured reward token is swept on every invocation even when the caller's claim touched none of them. Under another user's multiclaimOnBehalf is pending in the mempool and will land in the same block, is there an unprivileged sequence of `compound(address[] _lps, address[][] _rewards, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, bool _lockMgp)` that leaves `_convertRatio supplied by the caller` unreconciled with `the value being converted for other users`, violates the invariant that settlement must be scoped to the reward tokens the caller's claim actually produced, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/ManualCompound.sol -> `compound(address[] _lps, address[][] _rewards, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, bool _lockMgp)` (mechanism: rewards array iterated for every caller regardless of what they claimed)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `compound(address[] _lps, address[][] _rewards, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, bool _lockMgp)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: every element of _lps and _rewards, plus _convertRatio, _minRec and _lockMgp, with no restriction on who calls
- Exploit idea: the second loop iterates the full rewards array on every call, so every configured reward token is swept on every invocation even when the caller's claim touched none of them. Precondition: another user's multiclaimOnBehalf is pending in the mempool and will land in the same block.
- Invariant to test: settlement must be scoped to the reward tokens the caller's claim actually produced; concretely, `_convertRatio supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the value being converted for other users`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (every element of _lps and _rewards, plus _convertRatio, _minRec and _lockMgp, with no restriction on who calls) under another user's multiclaimOnBehalf is pending in the mempool and will land in the same block, asserting on every row that settlement must be scoped to the reward tokens the caller's claim actually produced.
