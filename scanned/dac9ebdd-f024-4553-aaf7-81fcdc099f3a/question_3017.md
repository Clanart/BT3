# Q3017: Keeper.RefundGasWithPrice - Refund Uses Fee Collector Module After Fees Were Not Escrowed

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `post-execution gas refund to Ethereum sender` while controlling `baseFee` and `fee cap`, under the precondition that baseFee changed at BeginBlock, drive `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas` in `x/evm/keeper/gas.go::Keeper.RefundGasWithPrice` so that refund uses fee collector module after fees were not escrowed, violating the invariant that gas limits below intrinsic or floor-data gas must not commit, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/gas.go::Keeper.RefundGasWithPrice`
- Entrypoint: `post-execution gas refund to Ethereum sender`
- Attacker controls: `baseFee`, `fee cap`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: refund uses fee collector module after fees were not escrowed through `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas`.
- Invariant to test: gas limits below intrinsic or floor-data gas must not commit.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: build a two-message Cosmos tx fixture and assert ante, execution, refund, and receipt invariants after FinalizeBlock.
