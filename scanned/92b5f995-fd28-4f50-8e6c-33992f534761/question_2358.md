# Q2358: accounts_db.load read-only cache incoherence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by submit transactions or make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that force repeated account lookups with high-churn account creation/close patterns, repeated reads, and same-pubkey updates across nearby slots so that read-only caching can return a version that writable/runtime paths would reject as stale, breaking the invariant that read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::load
- Entrypoint: submit transactions or make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that force repeated account lookups
- Attacker controls: high-churn account creation/close patterns, repeated reads, and same-pubkey updates across nearby slots
- Exploit idea: diff read-only and runtime-visible answers for the same account
- Invariant to test: read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare read-only cache results to direct runtime/bank reads after writes
