# Q592: Solana FinalizeTransfer::process replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public inbound flow through `finalize_transfer`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/finalize_transfer.rs::process` violate `inbound settlement must not let the same signed payload mint and release native custody under different account layouts or branch assumptions` in the `replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly` attack class because marks the nonce as used, either transfers native custody from the vault or mints bridged supply, then posts a finalize message back toward Near becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/finalize_transfer.rs::process`
- Entrypoint: `public inbound flow through `finalize_transfer``
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, mint/vault branch choice, recipient account, signed payload, and payer-funded account creation
- Exploit idea: Stress replay-protection state keyed only by nonce, transfer id, or bitmap position across branches and chains. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: inbound settlement must not let the same signed payload mint and release native custody under different account layouts or branch assumptions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Replay valid proofs/signatures with altered non-economic fields and assert that only the exact originally-settled event is rejected as already used. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
