# Q1222: Exploit ordering assumptions in calculate_work

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use attacker-controlled Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents so `calculate_work` validates the right inputs in the wrong order, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/header_chain/mod.rs::calculate_work
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Exploit idea: validate the right pieces in the wrong order using Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
