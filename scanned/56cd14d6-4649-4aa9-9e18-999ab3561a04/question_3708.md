# Q3708: zip via liquidate: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-collateral-expected` reach `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `liquidate` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-collateral-expected` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `zip` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
