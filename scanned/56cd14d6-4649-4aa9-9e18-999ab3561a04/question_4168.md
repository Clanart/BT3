# Q4168: collateral-remove via repay: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list reach `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) in a state where it satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? Given that it decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `repay` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
