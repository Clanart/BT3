# Q252: Solana log_metadata malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Solana `log_metadata` instruction` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::log_metadata` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity` under reads Solana token metadata and posts it back toward Near for cross-chain deployment flows, violating `metadata publication must not let a malicious mint or metadata account manufacture a remote asset identity that diverges from actual custody semantics`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::log_metadata`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `log_metadata` instruction`
- Attacker controls: mint account, metadata account contents, payer funding, and published payload fields
- Exploit idea: Exploit arbitrary token metadata calls, old/new ABI switching, or malformed strings in metadata proofs. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: metadata publication must not let a malicious mint or metadata account manufacture a remote asset identity that diverges from actual custody semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Publish or prove pathological metadata values and assert that downstream deployment and mapping logic still binds to the right remote asset and decimals. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
