# Q751: Exploit reorg boundary handling in work_only_circuit

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit reorg timing around Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents so `work_only_circuit` treats a non-canonical object as canonical long enough to mutate bridge state, corrupting the canonical header-chain state and total work and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/work_only/mod.rs::work_only_circuit
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Exploit idea: reorder or replay Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents across canonical and non-canonical views
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
