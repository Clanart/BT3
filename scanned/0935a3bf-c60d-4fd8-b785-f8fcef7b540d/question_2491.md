# Q2491: generate_index result-cloning chain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `generate_index` by submit transactions that create many attacker-controlled accounts with structured keys with many-account creation with common owners/layouts and repeated indexed reads so that large notification objects are cloned more than necessary, breaking the invariant that notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::generate_index
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that create many attacker-controlled accounts with structured keys
- Attacker controls: many-account creation with common owners/layouts and repeated indexed reads
- Exploit idea: look for repeated clones of the same large object
- Invariant to test: notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: profile allocations and clone counts while delivering large notifications
