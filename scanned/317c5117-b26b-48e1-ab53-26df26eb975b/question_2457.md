# Q2457: purge_slot_cleanup_chaining_keep_alt can serve state that disagrees with the cache (blockstore_purge.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `purge_slot_cleanup_chaining_keep_alt` in `ledger/src/blockstore/blockstore_purge.rs` with state that is committed on one fork and then observed from another, and make the entry contents verified during replay disagree with the entry contents used to update the bank, so that the invariant "Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `ledger/src/blockstore/blockstore_purge.rs` -> `purge_slot_cleanup_chaining_keep_alt()` (around line 131)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: state that is committed on one fork and then observed from another
- Exploit idea: Make `purge_slot_cleanup_chaining_keep_alt` read a cached value the attacker already invalidated, so a node with a warm cache commits different state than one that reloaded.
- Invariant to test: Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Test the path with the cache primed and cleared; assert the committed state is identical in both runs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy or upgrade a program, or poison the program cache, so honest validators execute different bytecode or produce different results for the same instruction.
