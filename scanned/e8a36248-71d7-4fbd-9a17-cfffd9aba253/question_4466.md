# Q4466: accrue-debt-asset via liquidate: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `liquidate` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering varied, and assert that the value `accrue-debt-asset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
