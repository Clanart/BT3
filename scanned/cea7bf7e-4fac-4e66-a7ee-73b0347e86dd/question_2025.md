# Q2025: resolve-or-create via liquidate-redeem: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, drive `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) — which allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names — to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, breaking the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-or-create` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
