# Q5913: clear_before_coinbase_height: order-independent multisig reuses a public-key slot as authority

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `clear_before_coinbase_height` (in `stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs`) via a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions), such that a key field is counted toward the threshold without a signature, breaking the invariant that authority slots filled == signatures verified — leading to multisig threshold bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs` -> `clear_before_coinbase_height`
- Entrypoint: a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions)
- Attacker controls: the full auth structure (singlesig/multisig/order-independent/sponsored), nonce, fee, chain id, version, payload, and post-condition list, plus mutation of their own signed transactions
- Exploit idea: a key field is counted toward the threshold without a signature
- Invariant to test: authority slots filled == signatures verified
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - multisig threshold bypass
- Fast validation: test an order-independent auth with a bare key field
