# Q4249: WombatStaking.deposit - fee split truncation drains the residual

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatStaking.sol, where _sendRewards() computes feeAmount = originalRewardAmount * feeInfo.value / DENOMINATOR per fee and subtracts each from _amount, so with several fees and a small reward the truncated residues never reach any rewarder and accumulate in the contract. Assuming several feeInfos entries are active at once and the harvested amount is small, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `IERC20(poolInfo.lpAddress).balanceOf(address(this))` and `lpReceived credited by IMintableERC20(receiptToken).mint` via `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper`, breaking the invariant that every harvested unit must end up either in a fee destination or in the pool rewarder and producing High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatStaking.sol -> `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper` (mechanism: fee split truncation drains the residual)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, _minimumLiquidity and _for, forwarded verbatim by WombatPoolHelper/V2/AnkrBNBPoolHelper
- Exploit idea: _sendRewards() computes feeAmount = originalRewardAmount * feeInfo.value / DENOMINATOR per fee and subtracts each from _amount, so with several fees and a small reward the truncated residues never reach any rewarder and accumulate in the contract. Precondition: several feeInfos entries are active at once and the harvested amount is small.
- Invariant to test: every harvested unit must end up either in a fee destination or in the pool rewarder; concretely, `IERC20(poolInfo.lpAddress).balanceOf(address(this))` must stay reconciled with `lpReceived credited by IMintableERC20(receiptToken).mint`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount, _minimumLiquidity and _for, forwarded verbatim by WombatPoolHelper/V2/AnkrBNBPoolHelper) under several feeInfos entries are active at once and the harvested amount is small, asserting on every row that every harvested unit must end up either in a fee destination or in the pool rewarder.
