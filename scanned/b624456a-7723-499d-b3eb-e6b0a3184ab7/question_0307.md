# Q0307: debt-remove-scaled via collateral-add: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `collateral-add` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `debt-remove-scaled` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
