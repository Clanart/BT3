# Q2579: mark_slot_frozen remove-unrooted state loss

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `mark_slot_frozen` by submit transactions that maximize write churn near slot boundaries with heavy write churn near slot-freeze boundaries so that state the runtime or RPC still needs can be removed because slot liveness assumptions are too aggressive, breaking the invariant that only truly unreachable unrooted state should be removed and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::mark_slot_frozen
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that maximize write churn near slot boundaries
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn near slot-freeze boundaries
- Exploit idea: look for premature removal under churn
- Invariant to test: only truly unreachable unrooted state should be removed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: drive fast fork/root churn with attacker-owned accounts and verify consistency afterward
