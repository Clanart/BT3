# Q4924: accrue-user-collateral via liquidate: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-collateral-expected` reach `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `liquidate` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `min-collateral-expected`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
