# Q0663: increment via repay: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) advances the user-id nonce. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `repay` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `increment` touches, run `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
