# Q2887: Tier Price Underpayment Across Mixed Context

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BandwidthManager.purchase(...) -> pallet_ismp::handle_unsigned(origin=None, messages)` with attacker-controlled authenticated purchase messages, app and chain identifiers, tier configuration values, and replay ordering and mixing bytes that were valid in one proof, chain, module, order, or beneficiary context with metadata interpreted in another context, and make `on_accept` buy more bandwidth than paid for by exploiting scaling, rounding, or token-decimal representation gaps so `the credited bandwidth or tier-month value` becomes inconsistent with `the amount actually paid in the configured fee token`, breaking the invariant that bandwidth credit must scale exactly with configured tier price, months purchased, and fee-token decimals and leading to High: valid activity resolves to the wrong beneficiary, wrong token amount, wrong reward amount, or wrong order value?

## Target
- File/function: modules/pallets/bandwidth/src/lib.rs::on_accept
- Entrypoint: BandwidthManager.purchase(...) -> pallet_ismp::handle_unsigned(origin=None, messages)
- Attacker controls: authenticated purchase messages, app and chain identifiers, tier configuration values, and replay ordering
- Exploit idea: Buy more bandwidth than paid for by exploiting scaling, rounding, or token-decimal representation gaps. Try a pair of otherwise valid artifacts where one verification step authenticates the old context and a later step consumes the new context.
- Invariant to test: bandwidth credit must scale exactly with configured tier price, months purchased, and fee-token decimals
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: valid activity resolves to the wrong beneficiary, wrong token amount, wrong reward amount, or wrong order value.
- Fast validation: Vary fee-token decimals, tier prices, and month counts and assert the credited subscription value equals the payment implied by configuration. Build two neighboring valid contexts and mutate only the binding field while asserting state, receipts, and balances stay unchanged.
