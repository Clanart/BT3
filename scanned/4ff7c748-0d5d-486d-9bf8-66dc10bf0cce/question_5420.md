# Q5420: WombatPoolHelper.depositNative - safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Starting from a state where the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, can an unprivileged EOA use `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` to leave `pid cached at construction` inconsistent with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, violating the invariant that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent and extracting High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Precondition: the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction.
- Invariant to test: an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`: constrain the setup so that the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, fuzz the attacker inputs (msg.value and _minimumLiquidity), and assert after every call that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent.
