# Q1188: process-debt-asset via liquidate: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `borrower`, any third-party principal reach `process-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761` -> `process-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `process-debt-asset` caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `liquidate` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `borrower`, any third-party principal across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `process-debt-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
