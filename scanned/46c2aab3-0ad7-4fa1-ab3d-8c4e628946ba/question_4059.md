# Q4059: total-assets via accrue: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `accrue` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-assets` touches, run `accrue` with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
