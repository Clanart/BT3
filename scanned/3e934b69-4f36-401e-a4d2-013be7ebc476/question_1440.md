# Q1440: unpack-u16 via deposit: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `deposit` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `unpack-u16` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
