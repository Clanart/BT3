# Q3785: ValidateEthBasic - Authinfo Gas Limit Diverges From Summed Ethereum Gas Limits

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a Cosmos-wrapped Ethereum transaction through `Ethereum extension-option ante basic validation` while controlling `AuthInfo fee/gas` and `signature values`, under the precondition that the same tx is seen in CheckTx and ReCheckTx, drive `RPC conversion -> MsgEthereumTx.BuildTx -> Cosmos tx decoding -> ante signature verification` in `ante/interfaces/setup.go::ValidateEthBasic` so that AuthInfo gas limit diverges from summed Ethereum gas limits, violating the invariant that the authenticated signer must be the only account whose nonce, balance, or code can change, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `ante/interfaces/setup.go::ValidateEthBasic`
- Entrypoint: `Ethereum extension-option ante basic validation`
- Attacker controls: `AuthInfo fee/gas`, `signature values`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: AuthInfo gas limit diverges from summed Ethereum gas limits through `RPC conversion -> MsgEthereumTx.BuildTx -> Cosmos tx decoding -> ante signature verification`.
- Invariant to test: the authenticated signer must be the only account whose nonce, balance, or code can change.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: write a focused Go unit test around the target function and assert bank supply, sender balance, nonce, code hash, logs, and receipt status before and after.
