# Q3200: interest-rate via call-ststx-ratio: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `call-ststx-ratio` twice with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched varied, and assert that the value `interest-rate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
