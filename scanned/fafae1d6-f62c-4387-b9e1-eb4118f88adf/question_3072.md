# Q3072: WombatPoolHelper.withdraw - burnReceiptToken is the last step and is not atomic with the payout

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, withdraw() pays out, then unstakes, then calls IWombatStaking(wombatStaking).burnReceiptToken, so between the payout and the burn the receipt-token supply still claims backing that has already left. Does `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, so that `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` diverges from `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`, the invariant that receipt supply must fall in the same step as the backing it represents is broken, and the result is Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: burnReceiptToken is the last step and is not atomic with the payout)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity and _minAmount, with the payout measured as a balance delta
- Exploit idea: withdraw() pays out, then unstakes, then calls IWombatStaking(wombatStaking).burnReceiptToken, so between the payout and the burn the receipt-token supply still claims backing that has already left. Precondition: the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg.
- Invariant to test: receipt supply must fall in the same step as the backing it represents; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` sequence atomically under the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, asserting at the end that `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` still equals `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
