# Q1381: SmartWomConvert.convertFor - mode selects a materially different settlement with no validation

## Question
wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol: _convertFor() treats _mode == 1 as a MasterMagpie deposit for _for, _mode == 2 as an mWomSV lockFor, and anything else as a plain transfer, so an unrecognised mode silently falls through to the transfer branch. Under the attacker has pushed mWom above the peg so currentRatio exceeds buybackThreshold and no swap leg runs, is there an unprivileged sequence of `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)` that leaves `currentRatio()` unreconciled with `buybackThreshold`, violates the invariant that an unrecognised routing mode must revert rather than silently take the least restrictive path, and delivers High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol -> `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: mode selects a materially different settlement with no validation)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _for, _convertRatio, _minRec and _mode, reachable directly and through ManualCompound.compound
- Exploit idea: _convertFor() treats _mode == 1 as a MasterMagpie deposit for _for, _mode == 2 as an mWomSV lockFor, and anything else as a plain transfer, so an unrecognised mode silently falls through to the transfer branch. Precondition: the attacker has pushed mWom above the peg so currentRatio exceeds buybackThreshold and no swap leg runs.
- Invariant to test: an unrecognised routing mode must revert rather than silently take the least restrictive path; concretely, `currentRatio()` must stay reconciled with `buybackThreshold`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the attacker has pushed mWom above the peg so currentRatio exceeds buybackThreshold and no swap leg runs, have the attacker run `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `currentRatio()` versus `buybackThreshold` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
