# Q2522: Starknet verify_borsh_signature parser boundary or offset manipulation at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public signature-check path through `deploy_token` and `fin_transfer`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::_verify_borsh_signature` violate `signature verification must be domain-separated and malleability-safe so one signature cannot authorize multiple Starknet bridge actions` in the `parser boundary or offset manipulation` attack class because hashes Borsh bytes with Keccak, reconstructs an Ethereum-style signature, and checks it against the configured derived address becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::_verify_borsh_signature`
- Entrypoint: `public signature-check path through `deploy_token` and `fin_transfer``
- Attacker controls: serialized Borsh payload bytes, signature `v/r/s`, and configured derived address
- Exploit idea: Attack offset arithmetic, length prefixes, bucket indices, or body slicing in proof decoders. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: signature verification must be domain-separated and malleability-safe so one signature cannot authorize multiple Starknet bridge actions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Light client verification bypass
- Fast validation: Fuzz minimal, maximal, and malformed lengths and assert that every accepted proof round-trips into exactly the intended structured fields. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
