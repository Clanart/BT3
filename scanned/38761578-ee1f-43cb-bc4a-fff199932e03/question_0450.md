# Q0450: iter-lookup-debt via repay: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `iter-lookup-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218` -> `iter-lookup-debt`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `repay` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `iter-lookup-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
