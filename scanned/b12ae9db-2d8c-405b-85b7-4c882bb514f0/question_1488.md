# Q1488: WombatPoolHelper.depositNative - safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Under the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, is there an unprivileged sequence of `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` that leaves `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` unreconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`, violates the invariant that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent, and delivers High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Precondition: the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested.
- Invariant to test: an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, then assert `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` and `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` end identical in both runs.
