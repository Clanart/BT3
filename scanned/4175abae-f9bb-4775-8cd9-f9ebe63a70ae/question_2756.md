# Q2756: NEAR bind_token refund unregister can sever state that callbacks still need via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `refund callback after public `bind_token`` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token_refund` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `unregister can sever state that callbacks still need` under refunds either the explicit callback amount or the whole attached deposit after token-binding attempts, violating `refund logic must never let an attacker keep a successful binding while reclaiming the full deposit, or lose funds on a successful bind due to callback ordering`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token_refund`
- Entrypoint: `refund callback after public `bind_token``
- Attacker controls: callback success or failure, predecessor account chosen for refund, and attached deposit
- Exploit idea: Target NEAR-style storage-management calls interleaved with yield/resume or token-delivery callbacks. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: refund logic must never let an attacker keep a successful binding while reclaiming the full deposit, or lose funds on a successful bind due to callback ordering
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Unregister between async stages and assert that later cleanup still finds or preserves enough state to finish safely. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
