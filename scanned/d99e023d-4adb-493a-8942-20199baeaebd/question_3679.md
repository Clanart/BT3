# Q3679: refresh via liquidate: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `collateral-receiver`, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `liquidate` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, then read `refresh` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
