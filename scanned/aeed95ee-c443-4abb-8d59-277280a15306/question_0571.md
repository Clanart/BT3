# Q0571: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.withdraw - withdraw releases the underlying before the stake check runs

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol: withdraw() calls IWombatStaking(wombatStaking).withdraw first, which sends the deposit token to msg.sender, and only afterwards calls _unstake, which is the step that actually verifies the caller had that much staked in MasterMagpie. Under the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, is there an unprivileged sequence of `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` that leaves `pid cached at construction` unreconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, violates the invariant that an entitlement must be verified before the value backing it leaves the protocol, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: withdraw releases the underlying before the stake check runs)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check
- Exploit idea: withdraw() calls IWombatStaking(wombatStaking).withdraw first, which sends the deposit token to msg.sender, and only afterwards calls _unstake, which is the step that actually verifies the caller had that much staked in MasterMagpie. Precondition: the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative.
- Invariant to test: an entitlement must be verified before the value backing it leaves the protocol; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, have the attacker run `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `pid cached at construction` versus `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
