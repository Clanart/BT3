# Q2437: remove_unrooted_slots notification context drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove_unrooted_slots` by submit transactions across fast fork churn and then query recent state with many-account write bursts, slot churn, and recent-state queries so that watcher or filter state can pair payloads with the wrong slot/root context, breaking the invariant that notification payloads and context must describe the same event/state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::remove_unrooted_slots
- Entrypoint: submit transactions across fast fork churn and then query recent state
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts, slot churn, and recent-state queries
- Exploit idea: look for impossible payload/context combinations
- Invariant to test: notification payloads and context must describe the same event/state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: cross-check delivered notifications against direct state at the same reported slot/root
