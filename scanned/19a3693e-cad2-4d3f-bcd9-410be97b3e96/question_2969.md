# Q2969: notify_vote stale cache replay

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_vote` by subscribe to votes and then drive hot transaction flow that affects vote visibility with vote subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot notification streams so that stale cached account content can outlive the storage or bank state that later logic expects, breaking the invariant that caches must not serve account data from an impossible slot/state combination and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_vote
- Entrypoint: subscribe to votes and then drive hot transaction flow that affects vote visibility
- Attacker controls: vote subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot notification streams
- Exploit idea: read an impossible old value after the canonical state has changed
- Invariant to test: caches must not serve account data from an impossible slot/state combination
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race rewrites and immediate reads, then diff cache-derived results against storage and bank views
