# Q5219: debt-preview via redeem: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
`debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Can an unprivileged caller of `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), by choosing the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, use that to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `redeem` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
