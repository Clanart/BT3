# Q1691: Exploit witness/annex edge cases in genesis_state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit witness, annex, or script-path edge cases in multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context so `genesis_state` verifies a different Bitcoin statement than later settlement relies on, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and violating the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/header_chain/mod.rs::genesis_state
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: make verification hash a different Bitcoin statement than settlement later uses via multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
