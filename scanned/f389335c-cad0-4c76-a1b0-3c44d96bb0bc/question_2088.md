# Q2088: get_connection_stake rent floor drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `get_connection_stake` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one unstaked client with connection identifiers, certificate/pubkey choices, source-ip reuse, and connection churn timing such that account resize, close, or reopen patterns can use a stale rent-exemption view, breaking the invariant that rent-exemption checks must use the final committed account layout and balance and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/nonblocking/quic.rs::get_connection_stake
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one unstaked client
- Attacker controls: connection identifiers, certificate/pubkey choices, source-IP reuse, and connection churn timing
- Exploit idea: search for pre-resize or pre-close rent assumptions that survive too long
- Invariant to test: rent-exemption checks must use the final committed account layout and balance
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: use realloc/close/open patterns and diff rent floor checks against final account sizes
