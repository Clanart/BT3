# Q608: NEAR omni-types Starknet events proof kind or event class confusion at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Starknet proof and deployment mapping flows` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-types/src/starknet/events.rs` violate `Starknet event parsing must stay domain-separated so event fields cannot collide with another chain’s asset or recipient model` in the `proof kind or event class confusion` attack class because defines Starknet-side event structures consumed by the broader bridge type system becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-types/src/starknet/events.rs`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet proof and deployment mapping flows`
- Attacker controls: Starknet event bytes, field ordering, and cross-chain address/string conversions
- Exploit idea: Look for outer proof envelopes that carry a kind tag separately from the payload bytes they validate. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: Starknet event parsing must stay domain-separated so event fields cannot collide with another chain’s asset or recipient model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Cross-check every proof kind against every parser and assert that no valid envelope can downcast into the wrong bridge action. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
