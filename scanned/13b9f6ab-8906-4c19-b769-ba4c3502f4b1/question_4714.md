# Q4714: vault-system-repay via liquidate: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `debt-amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `vault-system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `vault-system-repay` routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:207` -> `vault-system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-repay` routes a repayment to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
