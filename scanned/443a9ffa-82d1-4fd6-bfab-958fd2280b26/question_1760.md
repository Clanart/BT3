# Q1760: StateDB.SetBalance - State Override Accidentally Reaches Commit True Path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker execute a contract that moves EVM-denom value through nested calls through `state override and EVM balance mutation path` while controlling `SELFDESTRUCT target` and `bank balance`, under the precondition that StateDB has native bank writes and EVM dirty state in the same tx, drive `EVM CALL/SELFDESTRUCT -> StateDB native cache -> RevertToSnapshot -> Commit` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.SetBalance` so that state override accidentally reaches commit=true path, violating the invariant that Commit must be all-or-nothing for balance, nonce, code, storage, logs, and events, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.SetBalance`
- Entrypoint: `state override and EVM balance mutation path`
- Attacker controls: `SELFDESTRUCT target`, `bank balance`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: state override accidentally reaches commit=true path through `EVM CALL/SELFDESTRUCT -> StateDB native cache -> RevertToSnapshot -> Commit`.
- Invariant to test: Commit must be all-or-nothing for balance, nonce, code, storage, logs, and events.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: build a two-message Cosmos tx fixture and assert ante, execution, refund, and receipt invariants after FinalizeBlock.
