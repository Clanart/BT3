# Q2588: Backend.GetBlockReceipts - Receipt List Omits Block Gas Exceeded Txs That Were Charged

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker query protocol receipts or logs for crafted included Ethereum transactions through `eth_getBlockReceipts public JSON-RPC` while controlling `duplicate hash scenario` and `tx result events`, under the precondition that multiple Ethereum messages appear in one Cosmos transaction, drive `FinalizeBlock events -> KVIndexer.IndexBlock -> GetTransactionReceipt/GetBlockReceipts` in `rpc/backend/blocks.go::Backend.GetBlockReceipts` so that receipt list omits block-gas-exceeded txs that were charged, violating the invariant that failed transactions must not be represented as successful fund transfers, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/backend/blocks.go::Backend.GetBlockReceipts`
- Entrypoint: `eth_getBlockReceipts public JSON-RPC`
- Attacker controls: `duplicate hash scenario`, `tx result events`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: receipt list omits block-gas-exceeded txs that were charged through `FinalizeBlock events -> KVIndexer.IndexBlock -> GetTransactionReceipt/GetBlockReceipts`.
- Invariant to test: failed transactions must not be represented as successful fund transfers.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: run a local integration test that submits the crafted raw tx through JSON-RPC and compares committed state with direct keeper queries.
