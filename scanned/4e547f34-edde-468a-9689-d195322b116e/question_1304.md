# Q1304: send-tokens via repay: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) reach `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `repay` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) varied, and assert that the value `send-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
