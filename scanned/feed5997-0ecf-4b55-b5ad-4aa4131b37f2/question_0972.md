# Q0972: WombatPoolHelper.harvest - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Starting from a state where the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, can an unprivileged EOA use `harvest()` to leave `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` inconsistent with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`, violating the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value and extracting Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the exact block at which the pool's rewards are harvested and fee-split
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, then assert `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` and `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` end identical in both runs.
