# Q5394: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.depositLP - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
Consider wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, where WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Assuming the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` via `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`, breaking the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding and producing High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, snapshot `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, run the attacker's `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
