# Q2888: NEAR fin_transfer entry storage-preparation omission changes settlement meaning through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public `fin_transfer` proof-submission flow` with control over proof bytes, source chain selection, storage-deposit actions, attached deposit, and ordering of storage actions and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fin_transfer` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `storage-preparation omission changes settlement meaning` attack class because verifies a proof through the configured prover, optionally prepays storage for recipient and fee accounts, then dispatches to `fin_transfer_callback`, violating `one valid inbound proof must settle exactly once, on the correct asset and branch, without letting storage preparation alter what economic event is finalized`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fin_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public `fin_transfer` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, storage-deposit actions, attached deposit, and ordering of storage actions
- Exploit idea: Target recipient or fee-recipient storage checks that gate token delivery or fee minting. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: one valid inbound proof must settle exactly once, on the correct asset and branch, without letting storage preparation alter what economic event is finalized
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Reorder or omit storage-deposit actions and assert that settlement either fully aborts before finalization or completes with all intended recipients properly provisioned. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fin_transfer` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
