# Q5336: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, is there an unprivileged sequence of `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` that leaves `pid cached at construction` unreconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, violates the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding, and delivers High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence atomically under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, asserting at the end that `pid cached at construction` still equals `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
