# Q0072: current_shopify_session_id: An expired id_token with `check_session_expiry_date` true to fo...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params) reach `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb via GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy, supplying an expired id_token with `check_session_expiry_date` true to force `should_exchange_expired_token?` and a fresh exchange, so that session id must come from a fully verified id_token (sig, aud, dest, exp) before any load or exchange is violated, leading to authentication bypass / minting an access token for a shop the attacker does not own? Specifically confirm that no protected state is reachable by skipping or repeating an auth step.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb — `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange`
- Entrypoint: GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params — specifically an expired id_token with `check_session_expiry_date` true to force `should_exchange_expired_token?` and a fresh exchange.
- Exploit idea: Walk the auth state machine out of order (skip/repeat a step) and confirm no step can be reached unauthenticated.
- Invariant to test: session id must come from a fully verified id_token (sig, aud, dest, exp) before any load or exchange
- Expected Immunefi impact: authentication bypass / minting an access token for a shop the attacker does not own (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: state-machine test exercising out-of-order transitions and asserting each protected state still requires verification.
