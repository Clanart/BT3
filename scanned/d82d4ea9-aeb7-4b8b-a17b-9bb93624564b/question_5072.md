# Q5072: WombatBribeManager.castVotes - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. With the exact block at which every pending vote is pushed to Wombat and every bribe is harvested, plus the caller fee destination under attacker control and the attacker passes the same lp address several times in one array, can an unprivileged caller sequence `castVotes(bool swapForBnb)` so that `delegatedPool votes` and `totalVlMgpInVote` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates and realising Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `castVotes(bool swapForBnb)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `castVotes(bool swapForBnb)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the exact block at which every pending vote is pushed to Wombat and every bribe is harvested, plus the caller fee destination
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the attacker passes the same lp address several times in one array.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `delegatedPool votes` must stay reconciled with `totalVlMgpInVote`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the attacker passes the same lp address several times in one array, then assert `delegatedPool votes` and `totalVlMgpInVote` end identical in both runs.
