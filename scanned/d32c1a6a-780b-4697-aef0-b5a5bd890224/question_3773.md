# Q3773: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.depositNative - _minimumLiquidity is caller-supplied on the deposit leg

## Question
In wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, deposit() and depositNative() forward the caller's _minimumLiquidity into the Wombat deposit, so a caller can accept a deposit that mints far less LP than fair while the receipt mint is taken from the resulting delta. Starting from a state where the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, can an unprivileged EOA use `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` to leave `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` inconsistent with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`, violating the invariant that a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded and extracting Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: _minimumLiquidity is caller-supplied on the deposit leg)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: deposit() and depositNative() forward the caller's _minimumLiquidity into the Wombat deposit, so a caller can accept a deposit that mints far less LP than fair while the receipt mint is taken from the resulting delta. Precondition: the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes.
- Invariant to test: a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`: constrain the setup so that the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, fuzz the attacker inputs (msg.value and _minimumLiquidity), and assert after every call that a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded.
