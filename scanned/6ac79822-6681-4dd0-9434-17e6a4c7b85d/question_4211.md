# Q4211: vault-system-borrow via repay: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`vault-system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198) routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198` -> `vault-system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `repay` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `ft` trait principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
