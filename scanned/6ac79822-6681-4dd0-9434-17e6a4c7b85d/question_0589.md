# Q0589: resolve-pyth via collateral-remove: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), drive `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) — which reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), then read `resolve-pyth` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
