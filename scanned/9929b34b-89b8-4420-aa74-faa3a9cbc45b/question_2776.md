# Q2776: LegacyTx.Validate - Gasprice Nil Or Zero Interacts With Fee Deduction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a Cosmos-wrapped Ethereum transaction through `legacy Ethereum tx validation via eth_sendRawTransaction` while controlling `raw tx payload` and `message ordering`, under the precondition that the same Cosmos tx contains more than one MsgEthereumTx, drive `ValidateEthBasic -> VerifyEthSig -> VerifyFee -> EthereumTx -> ApplyTransaction` in `x/evm/types/legacy_tx.go::LegacyTx.Validate` so that gasPrice nil or zero interacts with fee deduction, violating the invariant that fee/gas AuthInfo must equal the embedded Ethereum tx data, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/types/legacy_tx.go::LegacyTx.Validate`
- Entrypoint: `legacy Ethereum tx validation via eth_sendRawTransaction`
- Attacker controls: `raw tx payload`, `message ordering`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: gasPrice nil or zero interacts with fee deduction through `ValidateEthBasic -> VerifyEthSig -> VerifyFee -> EthereumTx -> ApplyTransaction`.
- Invariant to test: fee/gas AuthInfo must equal the embedded Ethereum tx data.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: build a two-message Cosmos tx fixture and assert ante, execution, refund, and receipt invariants after FinalizeBlock.
