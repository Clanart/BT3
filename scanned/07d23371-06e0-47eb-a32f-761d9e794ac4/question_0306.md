# Q306: Accept wrong proof/network context in sync_citrea_txs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings through user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync so `sync_citrea_txs` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the L1/L2 height pair treated as finalized and safe to bridge against and breaking the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/sync.rs::sync_citrea_txs
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
