# Q2566: Duplicate queue or processing state in save_transaction_spent_utxos

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `save_transaction_spent_utxos` twice with attacker-controlled reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the storage-proof key/value binding used for deposit or withdrawal validation and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/bitcoin_syncer.rs::save_transaction_spent_utxos
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
