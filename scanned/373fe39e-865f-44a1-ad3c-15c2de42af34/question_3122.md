# Q3122: filter_account_result index inconsistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_account_result` by use in-scope account subscriptions and hot account churn with account subscription filters, encodings, and hot account streams so that indexes or lookup tables updated around this function can disagree with the stored account payloads they point to, breaking the invariant that indexes must resolve to the exact account version later returned to rpc or runtime callers and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_account_result
- Entrypoint: use in-scope account subscriptions and hot account churn
- Attacker controls: account subscription filters, encodings, and hot account streams
- Exploit idea: force same-pubkey and same-owner churn to look for torn index state
- Invariant to test: indexes must resolve to the exact account version later returned to RPC or runtime callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare indexed reads to direct storage reads during high-churn updates
