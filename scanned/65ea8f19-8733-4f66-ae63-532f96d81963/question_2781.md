# Q2781: accounts_cache.add_root same-pubkey churn hotspot

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `add_root` by submit transactions that touch many accounts near root advancement with many-account writes near root advancement so that rewriting one pubkey repeatedly creates pathological behavior that normal multi-pubkey load does not, breaking the invariant that hot-key churn should not create correctness or performance pathologies and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::add_root
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that touch many accounts near root advancement
- Attacker controls: many-account writes near root advancement
- Exploit idea: use hot-key churn rather than broad fanout
- Invariant to test: hot-key churn should not create correctness or performance pathologies
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: compare same-pubkey rewrite churn against equally large multi-pubkey churn
