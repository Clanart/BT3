# Q0053: refresh via liquidate-multi: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) — which rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the full batch list and its ordering, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
