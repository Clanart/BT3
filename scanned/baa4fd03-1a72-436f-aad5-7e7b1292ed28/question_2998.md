# Q2998: notify_roots size-accounting drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_roots` by subscribe to roots and then drive hot slot/root movement with root subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot root movement so that byte counters or cache-size accounting can undercount real resident or persisted account state, breaking the invariant that cache and storage size accounting must track actual resident state accurately and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_roots
- Entrypoint: subscribe to roots and then drive hot slot/root movement
- Attacker controls: root subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot root movement
- Exploit idea: use large-account churn to separate logical counts from physical bytes
- Invariant to test: cache and storage size accounting must track actual resident state accurately
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: measure counter growth against real resident bytes
