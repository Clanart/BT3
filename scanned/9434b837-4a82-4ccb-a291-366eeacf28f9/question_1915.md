# Q1915: increment via supply-collateral-add: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) advances the user-id nonce. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `amount`, use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, then read `increment` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
