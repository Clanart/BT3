# Q2230: Duplicate queue or processing state in create_fee_payer_utxo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `create_fee_payer_utxo` twice with attacker-controlled the `rbf_signing_info` object but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the fee-payer UTXO chain selected for CPFP/RBF and violating the invariant that queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/cpfp.rs::create_fee_payer_utxo
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `rbf_signing_info` object
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the `rbf_signing_info` object
- Invariant to test: queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
