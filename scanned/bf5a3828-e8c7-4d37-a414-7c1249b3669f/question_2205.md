# Q2205: on_stream_accepted widens instruction privileges (swqos.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `on_stream_accepted` in `streamer/src/nonblocking/swqos.rs` with an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure, and make the priority used to order a transaction disagree with the fee the transaction actually pays, so that the invariant "Callee privileges are always a subset of the caller's for the same account." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `streamer/src/nonblocking/swqos.rs` -> `on_stream_accepted()` (around line 445)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure
- Exploit idea: Use `on_stream_accepted` so the callee sees signer or writable privileges the caller never held, letting an attacker program act on a victim account.
- Invariant to test: Callee privileges are always a subset of the caller's for the same account.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Assert in a test that the callee's `is_signer`/`is_writable` for each account is implied by the parent instruction's.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy a program that reads or writes host/guest memory outside its permitted regions, or forges an account reference, and extracts or corrupts state belonging to other accounts.
