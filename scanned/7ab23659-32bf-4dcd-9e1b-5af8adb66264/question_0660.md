# Q0660: accrue-user-debts via collateral-remove: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the set of assets held reach `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it folds accrual over the position's debt list only, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the set of assets held across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `accrue-user-debts` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
