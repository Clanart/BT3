# Q4410: accrue-and-cache via repay: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `repay` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `accrue-and-cache` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
