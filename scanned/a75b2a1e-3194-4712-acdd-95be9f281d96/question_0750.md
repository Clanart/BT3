# Q750: Solana finalize_transfer asset-branch confusion on finalization

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public Solana `finalize_transfer` instruction` to make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::finalize_transfer` release value through a more favorable branch than the source event actually authorized because of verifies the NEAR-derived signature, uses `UsedNonces::use_nonce`, then either transfers from the native vault or mints bridged supply and posts a completion message back to Near, violating `a signed inbound transfer must settle exactly once to one mint/recipient pair and must not switch between native-vault and bridged-mint branches`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::finalize_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `finalize_transfer` instruction`
- Attacker controls: signed payload bytes, destination nonce, mint account, recipient account, vault existence, payer funding, and account ordering
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches.
- Invariant to test: a signed inbound transfer must settle exactly once to one mint/recipient pair and must not switch between native-vault and bridged-mint branches
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state.
