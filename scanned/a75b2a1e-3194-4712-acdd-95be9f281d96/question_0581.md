# Q581: EVM Wormhole finTransferExtension replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public settlement flow through `finTransfer` on Wormhole-backed chains` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::finTransferExtension` violate `completion messages must stay cryptographically bound to the exact settlement that occurred so fee claims and replay protection remain consistent across chains` in the `replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly` attack class because serializes a Wormhole `FinTransfer` payload and publishes it before incrementing the nonce becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::finTransferExtension`
- Entrypoint: `public settlement flow through `finTransfer` on Wormhole-backed chains`
- Attacker controls: msg.value, current `wormholeNonce`, origin chain, origin nonce, token address, amount, and fee recipient string
- Exploit idea: Stress replay-protection state keyed only by nonce, transfer id, or bitmap position across branches and chains. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: completion messages must stay cryptographically bound to the exact settlement that occurred so fee claims and replay protection remain consistent across chains
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Replay valid proofs/signatures with altered non-economic fields and assert that only the exact originally-settled event is rejected as already used. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
