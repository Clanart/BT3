# Q2017: evict_using_random_selection fee-charge mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `evict_using_random_selection` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs around cache pressure with many distinct program invocations, upgrade timing, and cache-pressure friendly workloads such that fee-payer debiting or fee calculation can diverge from the execution result that this function eventually commits or reports, breaking the invariant that fees charged, reported, and committed must match one another and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/loaded_programs.rs::evict_using_random_selection
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs around cache pressure
- Attacker controls: many distinct program invocations, upgrade timing, and cache-pressure friendly workloads
- Exploit idea: create an execution that undercharges or misattributes fees relative to actual work
- Invariant to test: fees charged, reported, and committed must match one another
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: compare declared fees, charged lamports, and committed fee counters
