# Q0820: find-debt-scaled via liquidate-multi: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `find-debt-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:621` -> `find-debt-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `find-debt-scaled` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing debt row indistinguishable from no debt. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
