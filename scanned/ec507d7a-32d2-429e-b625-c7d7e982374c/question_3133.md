# Q3133: Misbind storage-proof semantics in build_commit_transaction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings so `build_commit_transaction` treats one storage slot, value, or path as proving another, corrupting the linkage between Citrea state and a replacement deposit move transaction and violating the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/mod.rs::build_commit_transaction
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings
- Exploit idea: treat one storage slot/value/path as if it proved another using storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
