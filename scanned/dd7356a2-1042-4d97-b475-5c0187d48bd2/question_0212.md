# Q0212: ArbWomUp2.incentiveDeposit - the incentive pot is drainable by one oversized deposit

## Question
wombat/ArbWomUp2.sol: the tier walk has no per-transaction ceiling and the only bound is the contract's balance, so a single caller can take the entire remaining incentive. With _amount, _minMGPRec and _bullMode, all caller-supplied, with the bull leg swapping the contract's own tokens under attacker control and the caller sets _minMGPRec to zero and sandwiches the router pair, can an unprivileged caller sequence `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minMGPRec, bool _bullMode)` so that `rewardToSend` and `IERC20(busd).balanceOf(address(this))` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that an incentive pot must not be fully claimable by a single actor in one transaction and realising Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/ArbWomUp2.sol -> `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minMGPRec, bool _bullMode)` (mechanism: the incentive pot is drainable by one oversized deposit)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minMGPRec, bool _bullMode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, _minMGPRec and _bullMode, all caller-supplied, with the bull leg swapping the contract's own tokens
- Exploit idea: the tier walk has no per-transaction ceiling and the only bound is the contract's balance, so a single caller can take the entire remaining incentive. Precondition: the caller sets _minMGPRec to zero and sandwiches the router pair.
- Invariant to test: an incentive pot must not be fully claimable by a single actor in one transaction; concretely, `rewardToSend` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(busd).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the caller sets _minMGPRec to zero and sandwiches the router pair, snapshot `rewardToSend` and `IERC20(busd).balanceOf(address(this))`, run the attacker's `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minMGPRec, bool _bullMode)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
