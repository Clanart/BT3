# Q2225: Duplicate queue or processing state in attempt_sign_psbt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `attempt_sign_psbt` twice with attacker-controlled the `signed_tx_hex` payload but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the fee-payer UTXO chain selected for CPFP/RBF and violating the invariant that queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/rbf.rs::attempt_sign_psbt
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Invariant to test: queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
