# Q1321: Exploit replacement logic in send_no_funding_tx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the `signed_tx_hex` payload so `send_no_funding_tx` constructs a replacement path that copies the wrong witnesses, inputs, or fee logic, corrupting the binding between raw transaction bytes and the queued tx-sender metadata and violating the invariant that queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/lib.rs::send_no_funding_tx
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Exploit idea: copy the wrong witnesses, inputs, or fee logic by shaping the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Invariant to test: queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
