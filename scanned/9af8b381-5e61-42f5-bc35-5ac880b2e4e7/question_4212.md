# Q4212: resolve-ztoken via liquidate-multi: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `resolve-ztoken` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343` -> `resolve-ztoken`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ztoken` reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the trait principals supplied per entry across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `resolve-ztoken` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
