# Q4014: debt-preview via collateral-remove-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `receiver` for the underlying leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver` for the underlying leg across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `debt-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
