# Q3653: mWomSV.unlock - mWomSV has no forceUnLock so value can only leave through the full cooldown

## Question
wombat/mWomSV.sol: unlike VLMGP, wombat/mWomSV.sol exposes no forceUnLock path, so a slot whose accounting becomes inconsistent has no penalty-bearing escape hatch and the mWOM behind it cannot be recovered. Under the attacker repeats cancelUnlock and startUnlock inside one transaction, is there an unprivileged sequence of `unlock(uint256 _slotIndex)` that leaves `mWomSV.getUserTotalLocked(user)` unreconciled with `ArbWomUp3.calDoubledCounted(user)`, violates the invariant that every locked position must retain at least one reachable exit path under all reachable states, and delivers Critical - Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWomSV.sol -> `unlock(uint256 _slotIndex)` (mechanism: mWomSV has no forceUnLock so value can only leave through the full cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `unlock(uint256 _slotIndex)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _slotIndex and the redemption timing
- Exploit idea: unlike VLMGP, wombat/mWomSV.sol exposes no forceUnLock path, so a slot whose accounting becomes inconsistent has no penalty-bearing escape hatch and the mWOM behind it cannot be recovered. Precondition: the attacker repeats cancelUnlock and startUnlock inside one transaction.
- Invariant to test: every locked position must retain at least one reachable exit path under all reachable states; concretely, `mWomSV.getUserTotalLocked(user)` must stay reconciled with `ArbWomUp3.calDoubledCounted(user)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_slotIndex and the redemption timing) under the attacker repeats cancelUnlock and startUnlock inside one transaction, asserting on every row that every locked position must retain at least one reachable exit path under all reachable states.
