# Q0332: send-tokens via collateral-remove: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `send-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
