# Q0272: calc-final-liquidation-amounts via liquidate: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `debt-amount` reach `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:834) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it recomputes debt proportionally when collateral was capped, a SECOND re-derivation after `process-debt-asset` already capped once, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:834` -> `calc-final-liquidation-amounts`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` recomputes debt proportionally when collateral was capped, a SECOND re-derivation after `process-debt-asset` already capped once. Reach it through `liquidate` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `debt-amount` varied, and assert that the value `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
