# Q1978: MultiEvmHooks.PostTxProcessing - Hook Error Wrapping Hides Errstateconflict

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call a malicious contract from an unprivileged EOA through `configured EVM post-processing hooks` while controlling `value` and `post-hook result`, under the precondition that a post-processing hook is configured in production and can fail, drive `ApplyMessageWithConfig -> Prepare -> EVM CALL/CREATE -> gas/refund calculation -> StateDB.Commit` in `x/evm/keeper/hooks.go::MultiEvmHooks.PostTxProcessing` so that hook error wrapping hides ErrStateConflict, violating the invariant that post-hook state must be atomic with the EVM transaction, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/hooks.go::MultiEvmHooks.PostTxProcessing`
- Entrypoint: `configured EVM post-processing hooks`
- Attacker controls: `value`, `post-hook result`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: hook error wrapping hides ErrStateConflict through `ApplyMessageWithConfig -> Prepare -> EVM CALL/CREATE -> gas/refund calculation -> StateDB.Commit`.
- Invariant to test: post-hook state must be atomic with the EVM transaction.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: compare IndexBlock/GetTransactionReceipt/GetBlockReceipts output against direct block/result reconstruction for the same transaction.
