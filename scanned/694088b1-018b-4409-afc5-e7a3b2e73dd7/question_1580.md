# Q1580: prepare_next_cpi_instruction reserved-key bypass

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `prepare_next_cpi_instruction` by submit transactions that perform cpi with instruction ordering, signer seeds, duplicated account metas, writable/read-only aliasing, and nested cpi depth such that duplicated accounts or versioned message features let attacker-controlled keys slip past reserved-key assumptions, breaking the invariant that reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs::prepare_next_cpi_instruction
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that perform CPI
- Attacker controls: instruction ordering, signer seeds, duplicated account metas, writable/read-only aliasing, and nested CPI depth
- Exploit idea: search for paths where reserved-key checks see a different key set than execution
- Invariant to test: reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: construct versioned transactions whose ALT-expanded account set changes the effective key view
