# Q2538: add_root_and_flush_write_cache slow-consumer retention

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `add_root_and_flush_write_cache` by submit transactions that write many accounts near root transitions with many-account write bursts plus immediate root/read churn so that one slow subscriber can make state created around this function accumulate without bound, breaking the invariant that one slow subscriber must not create unbounded retained notification state and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::add_root_and_flush_write_cache
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that write many accounts near root transitions
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts plus immediate root/read churn
- Exploit idea: treat queue retention as the bug class
- Invariant to test: one slow subscriber must not create unbounded retained notification state
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: stop reading from one websocket and monitor retained notification memory
