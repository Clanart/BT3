# Q931: Misbind trusted context inside process_and_add_new_states_from_height

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_and_add_new_states_from_height` through public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline and make attacker-controlled the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit` bind to the wrong trusted context, so the operator signature set attached to a deposit is interpreted for one bridge action while authorizing another, violating the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/states/mod.rs::process_and_add_new_states_from_height
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: bind attacker-controlled the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit` to the wrong trusted bridge context
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
