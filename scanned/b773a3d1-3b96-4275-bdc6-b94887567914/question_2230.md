# Q2230: LegacyTx.Validate - Chain Id Derived From V Is Empty But Tx Is Accepted

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a Cosmos-wrapped Ethereum transaction through `legacy Ethereum tx validation via eth_sendRawTransaction` while controlling `signature values` and `AuthInfo fee/gas`, under the precondition that the sender has just enough EVM-denom balance for fee plus value, drive `NewAnteHandler route selection -> Ethereum ante decorators -> MsgEthereumTx execution` in `x/evm/types/legacy_tx.go::LegacyTx.Validate` so that chain ID derived from v is empty but tx is accepted, violating the invariant that extension options must route every message through the intended ante chain, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/types/legacy_tx.go::LegacyTx.Validate`
- Entrypoint: `legacy Ethereum tx validation via eth_sendRawTransaction`
- Attacker controls: `signature values`, `AuthInfo fee/gas`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: chain ID derived from v is empty but tx is accepted through `NewAnteHandler route selection -> Ethereum ante decorators -> MsgEthereumTx execution`.
- Invariant to test: extension options must route every message through the intended ante chain.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: add a fuzz case varying the attacker-controlled fields and differential-check against go-ethereum for tx validity, gas, nonce, and code/storage effects.
