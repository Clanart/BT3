# Q588: Solana log_metadata malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Solana `log_metadata` instruction` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::log_metadata` violate `metadata publication must not let a malicious mint or metadata account manufacture a remote asset identity that diverges from actual custody semantics` in the `malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity` attack class because reads Solana token metadata and posts it back toward Near for cross-chain deployment flows becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::log_metadata`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `log_metadata` instruction`
- Attacker controls: mint account, metadata account contents, payer funding, and published payload fields
- Exploit idea: Exploit arbitrary token metadata calls, old/new ABI switching, or malformed strings in metadata proofs. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: metadata publication must not let a malicious mint or metadata account manufacture a remote asset identity that diverges from actual custody semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Publish or prove pathological metadata values and assert that downstream deployment and mapping logic still binds to the right remote asset and decimals. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
