# Q1059: process_transaction loaded-data undercount

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_transaction` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with instruction order, duplicated accounts, nonce/blockhash choices, and fee / compute settings such that loaded-accounts-data accounting can be made smaller than the real memory footprint or persisted delta, breaking the invariant that loaded account data size must track real loaded and committed state accurately and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::process_transaction
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: instruction order, duplicated accounts, nonce/blockhash choices, and fee / compute settings
- Exploit idea: aim for account-resize and ALT-heavy transactions that undercount loaded state
- Invariant to test: loaded account data size must track real loaded and committed state accurately
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: compare loaded-accounts-data counters to actual touched and resized account bytes
