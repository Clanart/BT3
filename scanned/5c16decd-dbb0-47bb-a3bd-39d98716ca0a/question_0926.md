# Q0926: oracle-price-legal via call-ststx-ratio: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `call-ststx-ratio` twice with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block varied, and assert that the value `oracle-price-legal` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
