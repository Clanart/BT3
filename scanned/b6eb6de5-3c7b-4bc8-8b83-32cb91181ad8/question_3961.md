# Q3961: to clvm collapse distinct inputs into one accepted state via curried program argument trees

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker serialize typed values back into CLVM targeting `to_clvm` in `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs` with curried program argument trees when the same payload is parsed through public bindings make chia_rs collapse distinct inputs into one accepted state, violating the invariant that curried argument hashes match executed programs, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs:124` / `to_clvm`
- Entrypoint: serialize typed values back into CLVM
- Attacker controls: curried program argument trees
- Exploit idea: Drive `to_clvm` through its public caller path using curried program argument trees; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: curried argument hashes match executed programs
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data
- Fast validation: differential-test curried tree hash against executing the curried program.
