# Q1437: deposit queue fairness break

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `deposit` by submit transactions invoking writable-account instructions with lamport amounts, account ownership transitions, cpi ordering, and close/reopen patterns such that attacker-chosen transactions make this function occupy shared scheduling resources long enough to starve cheaper work, breaking the invariant that one heavy transaction shape must not monopolize shared scheduling resources and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::deposit
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking writable-account instructions
- Attacker controls: lamport amounts, account ownership transitions, CPI ordering, and close/reopen patterns
- Exploit idea: measure unfair occupancy rather than raw throughput
- Invariant to test: one heavy transaction shape must not monopolize shared scheduling resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: replay one heavy shape alongside cheap transfers and compare scheduling latency
