# Q0610: calc-utilization via supply-collateral-add: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
