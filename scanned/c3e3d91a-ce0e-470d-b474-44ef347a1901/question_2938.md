# Q2938: notify_slot slow-consumer retention

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_slot` by trigger slot-related subscriptions and then drive hot transaction flow with slow consumer behavior and high-frequency slot events so that one slow subscriber can make state created around this function accumulate without bound, breaking the invariant that one slow subscriber must not create unbounded retained notification state and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_slot
- Entrypoint: trigger slot-related subscriptions and then drive hot transaction flow
- Attacker controls: slow consumer behavior and high-frequency slot events
- Exploit idea: treat queue retention as the bug class
- Invariant to test: one slow subscriber must not create unbounded retained notification state
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: stop reading from one websocket and monitor retained notification memory
