# Q0011: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, where _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Assuming the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, breaking the invariant that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution and producing Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Precondition: the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative.
- Invariant to test: the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, then assert `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` end identical in both runs.
