# Q1715: Confuse replacement linkage in get_current_l2_block_height

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes so `get_current_l2_block_height` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the linkage between Citrea state and a replacement deposit move transaction to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/citrea.rs::get_current_l2_block_height
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
