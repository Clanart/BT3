# Q788: AccessListTx.Validate - Invalid To Address Normalizes To A Spendable Address

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a Cosmos-wrapped Ethereum transaction through `EIP-2930 access-list transaction submission` while controlling `signature values` and `chain ID`, under the precondition that the sender has just enough EVM-denom balance for fee plus value, drive `RPC conversion -> MsgEthereumTx.BuildTx -> Cosmos tx decoding -> ante signature verification` in `x/evm/types/access_list_tx.go::AccessListTx.Validate` so that invalid to address normalizes to a spendable address, violating the invariant that the authenticated signer must be the only account whose nonce, balance, or code can change, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/types/access_list_tx.go::AccessListTx.Validate`
- Entrypoint: `EIP-2930 access-list transaction submission`
- Attacker controls: `signature values`, `chain ID`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: invalid to address normalizes to a spendable address through `RPC conversion -> MsgEthereumTx.BuildTx -> Cosmos tx decoding -> ante signature verification`.
- Invariant to test: the authenticated signer must be the only account whose nonce, balance, or code can change.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: construct a contract harness that performs nested CALL/CREATE/SELFDESTRUCT/revert and compare bank keeper balances with StateDB balances.
