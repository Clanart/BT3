# Q1624: Exploit witness/annex edge cases in handle_reorg_events

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit witness, annex, or script-path edge cases in the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof so `handle_reorg_events` verifies a different Bitcoin statement than later settlement relies on, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and violating the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/bitcoin_syncer.rs::handle_reorg_events
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Exploit idea: make verification hash a different Bitcoin statement than settlement later uses via the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
