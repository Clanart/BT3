# Q1296: transfer nonce replay window

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `transfer` by submit transactions invoking the system program with lamport amounts, duplicated accounts, seeded addresses, and multi-instruction ordering such that durable nonce or recent-blockhash state can be observed one way here and a different way later in the same submission lifecycle, breaking the invariant that nonce and blockhash freshness checks must be stable across the full processing pipeline and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::transfer
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking the system program
- Attacker controls: lamport amounts, duplicated accounts, seeded addresses, and multi-instruction ordering
- Exploit idea: find a same-slot or retry-driven way to reuse a nonce or stale blockhash window
- Invariant to test: nonce and blockhash freshness checks must be stable across the full processing pipeline
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: replay durable-nonce and edge-age blockhash transactions across retries and batches
