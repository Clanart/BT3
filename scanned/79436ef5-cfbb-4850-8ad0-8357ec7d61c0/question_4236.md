# Q4236: WombatStaking.deposit - bonus reward before-balances captured before an attacker-timed transfer

## Question
wombat/WombatStaking.sol - _rewardBeforeBalances() snapshots balances immediately before the MasterWombat call, so a bonus token transferred into WombatStaking between the snapshot and the delta is credited as harvested reward and queued to the pool rewarder. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _amount, _minimumLiquidity and _for, forwarded verbatim by WombatPoolHelper/V2/AnkrBNBPoolHelper, under several feeInfos entries are active at once and the harvested amount is small, exploit this through `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper` to break the reconciliation between `isPoolFeeFree[_lpToken]` and `feeInfos.length` and the invariant that harvest accounting must not credit tokens that were not produced by the harvest, yielding High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatStaking.sol -> `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper` (mechanism: bonus reward before-balances captured before an attacker-timed transfer)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(address,uint256,uint256,address,address) via a pool helper`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, _minimumLiquidity and _for, forwarded verbatim by WombatPoolHelper/V2/AnkrBNBPoolHelper
- Exploit idea: _rewardBeforeBalances() snapshots balances immediately before the MasterWombat call, so a bonus token transferred into WombatStaking between the snapshot and the delta is credited as harvested reward and queued to the pool rewarder. Precondition: several feeInfos entries are active at once and the harvested amount is small.
- Invariant to test: harvest accounting must not credit tokens that were not produced by the harvest; concretely, `isPoolFeeFree[_lpToken]` must stay reconciled with `feeInfos.length`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount, _minimumLiquidity and _for, forwarded verbatim by WombatPoolHelper/V2/AnkrBNBPoolHelper) under several feeInfos entries are active at once and the harvested amount is small, asserting on every row that harvest accounting must not credit tokens that were not produced by the harvest.
