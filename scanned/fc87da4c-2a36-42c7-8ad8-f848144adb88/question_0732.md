# Q732: NEAR token-deployer deploy_token partial deployment rollback leaves live alias

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger a partial failure through `cross-contract token deployment reached from public Near `deploy_token` callback` such that `near/token-deployer/src/lib.rs::deploy_token` leaves behind either a live token without mappings or mappings without a usable token because of controller-only deployer creates a new token subaccount and initializes metadata that downstream bridge flows will trust as canonical, violating `deployment into a predictable subaccount must not let an attacker reuse state, collide names, or create a token whose runtime semantics diverge from the bridge’s assumed wrapped-token model`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/token-deployer/src/lib.rs::deploy_token`
- Entrypoint: `cross-contract token deployment reached from public Near `deploy_token` callback`
- Attacker controls: account id chosen for the new token, metadata supplied by a validated bridge proof, and global code hash state
- Exploit idea: Look for deployment flows that cross multiple contracts or callbacks before all state is committed.
- Invariant to test: deployment into a predictable subaccount must not let an attacker reuse state, collide names, or create a token whose runtime semantics diverge from the bridge’s assumed wrapped-token model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each subcall to fail independently and assert that the resulting state is either fully rolled back or fully usable, never half-bound.
