# Q2168: Substitute a wrong proof path into work_conversion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker substitute part of attacker-controlled the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering so `work_conversion` accepts a proof, header, or path that should have been rejected, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and breaking the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/work_only/mod.rs::work_conversion
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Exploit idea: swap part of attacker-controlled the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering while keeping the rest seemingly valid
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
