# Q0780: mWomSV.startUnlock - getUserTotalLocked underflow bricks the position

## Question
In wombat/mWomSV.sol, getUserTotalLocked() subtracts getUserAmountInCoolDown(user) from the MasterMagpie stake with no floor, so any divergence between the two makes balanceOf, getRewardablePercentWAD, startUnlock and every rewarder settlement revert permanently for that account. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `startUnlock(uint256 _amountToCoolDown)` while the attacker's slot matured one block ago, and drive `getUserTotalLocked(user)` out of agreement with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(mWomSV,user).staked` - breaking the invariant that the locked-balance accessor must never revert, and a user must always be able to read and exit - for Critical - Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWomSV.sol -> `startUnlock(uint256 _amountToCoolDown)` (mechanism: getUserTotalLocked underflow bricks the position)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `startUnlock(uint256 _amountToCoolDown)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountToCoolDown and the timestamps written into the slot
- Exploit idea: getUserTotalLocked() subtracts getUserAmountInCoolDown(user) from the MasterMagpie stake with no floor, so any divergence between the two makes balanceOf, getRewardablePercentWAD, startUnlock and every rewarder settlement revert permanently for that account. Precondition: the attacker's slot matured one block ago.
- Invariant to test: the locked-balance accessor must never revert, and a user must always be able to read and exit; concretely, `getUserTotalLocked(user)` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(mWomSV,user).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amountToCoolDown and the timestamps written into the slot) under the attacker's slot matured one block ago, asserting on every row that the locked-balance accessor must never revert, and a user must always be able to read and exit.
