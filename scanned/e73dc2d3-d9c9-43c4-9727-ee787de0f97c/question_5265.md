# Q5265: SmartWomConvert.smartConvert - shared mWOM balance is settled to whoever calls next

## Question
wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol: mode 1 and mode 2 approve and forward obtainedmWomAmount out of the contract's own balance rather than out of a per-user ledger, so mWOM stranded in this contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to the next caller. Under _convertRatio is set to zero so the entire input goes through the AMM, is there an unprivileged sequence of `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` that leaves `obtainedmWomAmount` unreconciled with `IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this))`, violates the invariant that one caller must never be settled out of value another caller left behind, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol -> `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: shared mWOM balance is settled to whoever calls next)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountIn and _mode, plus the pool state that currentRatio and maxSwapAmount are read from
- Exploit idea: mode 1 and mode 2 approve and forward obtainedmWomAmount out of the contract's own balance rather than out of a per-user ledger, so mWOM stranded in this contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to the next caller. Precondition: _convertRatio is set to zero so the entire input goes through the AMM.
- Invariant to test: one caller must never be settled out of value another caller left behind; concretely, `obtainedmWomAmount` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up _convertRatio is set to zero so the entire input goes through the AMM, snapshot `obtainedmWomAmount` and `IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this))`, run the attacker's `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
