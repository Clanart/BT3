# Q3951: total-assets-preview via deposit: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `deposit` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-assets-preview` touches, run `deposit` with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
