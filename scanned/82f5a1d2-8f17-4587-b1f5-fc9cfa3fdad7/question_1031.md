# Q1031: verify_request: A missing HMAC header driving `secure_compare(nil, ...)`

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the raw body and X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header) reach `verify_request` in app/controllers/shopify_app/extension_verification_controller.rb via POST to any controller subclassing ExtensionVerificationController, supplying a missing HMAC header driving `secure_compare(nil, ...)`, so that extension requests must be rejected before any action body runs when HMAC is invalid is violated, leading to forged extension request accepted (auth bypass)? Specifically confirm that the malicious input stays rejected across refactors (pinned fixture).

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/extension_verification_controller.rb — `verify_request`
- Entrypoint: POST to any controller subclassing ExtensionVerificationController
- Attacker controls: the raw body and X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header — specifically a missing HMAC header driving `secure_compare(nil, ...)`.
- Exploit idea: Encode the exact malicious input as a fixture so a future refactor can't silently reopen the hole.
- Invariant to test: extension requests must be rejected before any action body runs when HMAC is invalid
- Expected Immunefi impact: forged extension request accepted (auth bypass) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: regression fixture pinning the malicious input to a rejected outcome for CI.
