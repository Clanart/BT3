# Q2971: notify_or_defer_confirmed_banks settles one authorization twice (optimistically_confirmed_bank_tracker.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `notify_or_defer_confirmed_banks` in `rpc/src/optimistically_confirmed_bank_tracker.rs` with an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction, and have `notify_or_defer_confirmed_banks` apply the same authorized effect a second time, so that the invariant "One signed authorization produces exactly one state effect." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/optimistically_confirmed_bank_tracker.rs` -> `notify_or_defer_confirmed_banks()` (around line 229)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction
- Exploit idea: Get `notify_or_defer_confirmed_banks` to apply the same logical effect twice from a single user authorization by re-entering it or replaying the surrounding flow.
- Invariant to test: One signed authorization produces exactly one state effect.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Integration test: submit the flow twice (and once re-entrantly) and assert the second application is rejected and balances moved once.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can escalate instruction privileges through CPI, account serialization, or signer-seed handling and mutate or drain an account the top-level transaction never authorized as writable or signed.
