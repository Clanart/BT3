# Q1320: transfer fee-payer unlock split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `transfer` by submit transactions invoking the system program with lamport amounts, duplicated accounts, seeded addresses, and multi-instruction ordering such that fee-payer lock or unlock handling may diverge from the accounts actually charged later, breaking the invariant that fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::transfer
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking the system program
- Attacker controls: lamport amounts, duplicated accounts, seeded addresses, and multi-instruction ordering
- Exploit idea: try to free or relock the fee payer at the wrong moment
- Invariant to test: fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace fee-payer lock state across retries, conflicts, and partial failures
