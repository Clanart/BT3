# Q2814: Solana FinalizeTransfer::process stale or reordered proof acceptance via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public inbound flow through `finalize_transfer`` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/finalize_transfer.rs::process` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `stale or reordered proof acceptance` under marks the nonce as used, either transfers native custody from the vault or mints bridged supply, then posts a finalize message back toward Near, violating `inbound settlement must not let the same signed payload mint and release native custody under different account layouts or branch assumptions`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/finalize_transfer.rs::process`
- Entrypoint: `public inbound flow through `finalize_transfer``
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, mint/vault branch choice, recipient account, signed payload, and payer-funded account creation
- Exploit idea: Focus on receipt ids, VAA sequence use, block-hash freshness, and whether replay state keys the exact economic event. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: inbound settlement must not let the same signed payload mint and release native custody under different account layouts or branch assumptions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Submit old proofs after later events and assert that replay protection and freshness checks reject them without stranding legitimate state. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
