# Q2231: get-full-position via liquidate-multi: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the full batch list and its ordering, use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the full batch list and its ordering, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
