# Q2424: zip via collateral-remove-redeem: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `zip` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
