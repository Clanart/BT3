# Q5244: send-underlying via liquidate-redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `send-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296` -> `send-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `send-underlying` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
