# Q0753: capitalization grows memory without an enforced bound (bank.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `capitalization` in `runtime/src/bank.rs` with a path that consumes the resource before the meter is charged, and grow the buffer `capitalization` feeds without any eviction bound taking effect, so that the invariant "Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank.rs` -> `capitalization()` (around line 5730)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a path that consumes the resource before the meter is charged
- Exploit idea: Repeatedly drive `capitalization` so a buffer, map, or cache it feeds grows without eviction, exhausting node memory below the cost the attacker pays.
- Invariant to test: Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Stress the path and assert the container's size plateaus rather than growing linearly with attacker input.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can perform syscall, CPI, memory-mapping, or deserialization work whose real CPU/memory cost far exceeds the compute units charged, degrading nodes below true cost.
