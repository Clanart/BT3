# Q1368: accrue via redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption reach `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835` -> `accrue`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale. Reach it through `redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `accrue` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
