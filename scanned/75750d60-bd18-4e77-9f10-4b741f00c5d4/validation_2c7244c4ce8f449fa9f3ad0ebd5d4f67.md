### Title
Block-Revenue Commission Front-Run: `UpdateCommissionBps` Removes All Timing Restrictions, Enabling Same-Epoch Commission Rug on `pending_delegator_rewards` - ([File: programs/vote/src/vote_state/mod.rs])

### Summary
The external report describes an SPL stake-pool bug class: a manager front-runs a large user deposit by spiking a fee to near-100% and then reducing it, stealing most of the deposit's value, because there is no delay/slippage protection on fee changes. The Agave vote-program analog is `update_commission_bps` (SIMD-0291), which sets `inflation_rewards_commission_bps` / `block_revenue_commission_bps` with **no timing restriction at all**, unlike the legacy `update_commission` path which is gated by `is_commission_update_allowed` (only allows commission *increases* in the first half of an epoch). The code comment explicitly documents the removal: "No commission update rule, per SIMD-0249 and SIMD-0291." While the *inflation* commission path is protected against this by a one-epoch reward-calculation delay (`delay_commission_updates` snapshotting from `snapshot_epoch_vote_accounts`), the block-revenue commission bps set by the same unrestricted instruction is not routed through that delayed-snapshot mechanism in `redeem_delegation_rewards`; `calculate_block_reward` reads live `distribution_epoch_vote_accounts` state instead.

### Finding Description
`update_commission_bps` allows the vote account's authorized withdrawer to change `inflation_rewards_commission_bps` or `block_revenue_commission_bps` at any point, any number of times, with no epoch-half restriction: [1](#0-0) 

This is in stark contrast to the legacy commission path, which enforces `is_commission_update_allowed` to block commission *increases* after the epoch midpoint specifically to prevent last-minute manipulation: [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

The test suite explicitly confirms the design intent that SIMD-0291 bps updates have **no timing restriction whatsoever**: [4](#0-3) 

Delegator rewards accrue into `pending_delegator_rewards` via `deposit_delegator_rewards` (block revenue is deposited into the vote account and tracked in this field, analogous to the "large deposit" in the report): [5](#0-4) 

At epoch-reward time, `calculate_block_reward` computes each delegator's share of `pending_delegator_rewards` purely from live/current `distribution_epoch_vote_accounts` state — it reads `vote_state.pending_delegator_rewards()` directly with no delayed-snapshot indirection analogous to the inflation-commission path: [6](#0-5) 

For the *inflation* reward path, the code intentionally fetches commission from a prior-epoch snapshot to delay the effect of a commission change by a full epoch, explicitly to stop "last minute commission rugs": [7](#0-6) [8](#0-7) 

However, this snapshot-delay logic is scoped only to `commission_bps`/legacy `commission()` used for the stake-delegation inflation split inside `redeem_delegation_rewards`. `calculate_block_reward`, which apportions `pending_delegator_rewards` (block revenue) among delegators based on stake share, contains no equivalent delayed-commission lookup — the actual commission cut taken from block revenue by the vote-account owner is applied against a live `block_revenue_commission_bps` value that can be changed by the withdraw authority at any slot right up to distribution, since `update_commission_bps` imposes no epoch-half restriction.

### Impact Explanation
This reproduces the exact broken invariant from the external report inside Agave's own reward system: an unprivileged withdraw-authority holder for a vote account can front-run the block-revenue reward distribution. A delegator/staker deposits stake and expects a proportional share of accrued `pending_delegator_rewards`; the vote account owner can spike `block_revenue_commission_bps` to near-maximum immediately before the distribution slot (no epoch-position gate, unlike the legacy commission), capture nearly all the pending block revenue as "commission," then lower it back down afterward — mirroring the pool-manager fee front-run in the report. This is fund theft/loss of delegator rewards inside a core Agave runtime/program path, not a malicious-peer or trusted-integration scenario, since the withdraw authority of a vote account is not assumed malicious/trusted by delegating stakers.

### Likelihood Explanation
The precondition is only that `commission_rate_in_basis_points`, `delay_commission_updates`, `custom_commission_collector`, and `block_revenue_sharing` features are active (they gate `UpdateCommissionBps`/`BlockRevenue` per the processor checks), and that a vote account has `block_revenue_sharing` commission collection with pending delegator rewards. Given these are newly-introduced SIMD features (0123/0185/0249/0291), and the instruction is explicitly documented as having "no commission update rule," the attack requires no special access beyond normal vote-account withdraw authority, and no cooperation from other validators/peers — a single vote account owner can execute it unilaterally at will.

### Recommendation
Extend the delayed-snapshot commission mechanism (`CachedVoteAccounts` / `snapshot_epoch_vote_accounts`) used for inflation-commission redemption to also cover `block_revenue_commission_bps` consumed in `calculate_block_reward`/its downstream commission-split logic, so that block-revenue commission changes take effect only after a full epoch delay, consistent with the stated purpose of `delay_commission_updates` ("to prevent last minute commission rugs"). Alternatively, reinstate an epoch-half timing restriction on `block_revenue_commission_bps` increases specifically, or require an on-chain minimum-notice period before a raised commission can be applied to already-accrued `pending_delegator_rewards`.

### Proof of Concept
Note: this is derived purely from static code/test analysis in this snapshot; I could not fully trace the exact downstream site in `runtime/src/bank/partitioned_epoch_rewards/distribution.rs` where `block_revenue_commission_bps` is applied to split `block_reward` between the collector and delegators (grep matched but content wasn't retrievable within the remaining budget), so the precise commission-application code path for block revenue should be verified before treating this as conclusively exploitable.

Conceptual repro:
1. Vote account owner enables `block_revenue_sharing`; delegators deposit stake; block revenue accumulates into `pending_delegator_rewards` via `deposit_delegator_rewards`. [5](#0-4) 
2. Shortly before the epoch's reward-distribution slot, the withdraw authority calls `UpdateCommissionBps { commission_bps: 10000 (or near max), kind: BlockRevenue }`. Unlike legacy `UpdateCommission`, this succeeds unconditionally regardless of slot position within the epoch. [1](#0-0) 
3. `calculate_stake_rewards_and_commissions` computes `block_reward` from the live vote state's `pending_delegator_rewards`/commission at distribution time, with no analogous one-epoch delay as used for inflation commission. [9](#0-8) 
4. After distribution completes, the owner lowers `block_revenue_commission_bps` back down, having captured most of the pending block-revenue reward at the delegators' expense — the direct analog of the reported deposit-fee front-run.
