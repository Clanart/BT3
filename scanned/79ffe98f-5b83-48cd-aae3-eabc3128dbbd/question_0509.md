# Q509: Misbind trusted context inside internal_create_watchtower_challenge

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `internal_create_watchtower_challenge` through auth-bypass attempt into gRPC `ClementineVerifier.InternalCreateWatchtowerChallenge` and make attacker-controlled the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering bind to the wrong trusted context, so the nofn aggregate key and covenant context is interpreted for one bridge action while authorizing another, violating the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/rpc/verifier.rs::internal_create_watchtower_challenge
- Entrypoint: auth-bypass attempt into gRPC `ClementineVerifier.InternalCreateWatchtowerChallenge`
- Attacker controls: the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering
- Exploit idea: bind attacker-controlled the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering to the wrong trusted bridge context
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
