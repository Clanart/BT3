# Q0295: vault-system-borrow via repay: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`vault-system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198) routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198` -> `vault-system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `repay` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `vault-system-borrow` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
