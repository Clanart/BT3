# Q1731: translate_instruction_rust ALT account explosion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `translate_instruction_rust` by submit transactions that perform cpi with nested instruction payloads, duplicated accounts, signer seeds, and edge-case account lists such that address lookup tables make this function handle a much larger effective account surface than the early admission logic prices, breaking the invariant that versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/cpi.rs::translate_instruction_rust
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that perform CPI
- Attacker controls: nested instruction payloads, duplicated accounts, signer seeds, and edge-case account lists
- Exploit idea: use legal ALT expansion to amplify load, lock, or verification work
- Invariant to test: versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: benchmark identical logic with and without ALT expansion
