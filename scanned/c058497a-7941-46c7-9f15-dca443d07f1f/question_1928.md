# Q1928: EVM OmniBridge native/bridged branching asset-branch confusion on finalization at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public EVM init/finalize entrypoints` with boundary-controlled inputs covering zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::finTransfer and initTransfer` violate `branch selection must never be attacker-steerable toward a more profitable asset path than the one the signed or emitted payload actually authorizes` in the `asset-branch confusion on finalization` attack class because selects between ETH release, ERC-1155 transfer, custom-minter mint/burn, bridge-token mint/burn, or plain ERC-20 custody based on mutable branch predicates becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::finTransfer and initTransfer`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM init/finalize entrypoints`
- Attacker controls: zero address versus token address, custom-minter registration, bridge-token registration, and message presence
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches. Concentrate on zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values.
- Invariant to test: branch selection must never be attacker-steerable toward a more profitable asset path than the one the signed or emitted payload actually authorizes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state. Sweep boundary values for zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
