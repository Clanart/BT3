# Q1016: bank_fields_from_snapshot_archives can serve state that disagrees with the cache (snapshot_bank_utils.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `bank_fields_from_snapshot_archives` in `runtime/src/snapshot_bank_utils.rs` with a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot, and make the epoch boundary state computed by this node disagree with the state computed by a node that replayed the same blocks, so that the invariant "Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/snapshot_bank_utils.rs` -> `bank_fields_from_snapshot_archives()` (around line 66)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot
- Exploit idea: Make `bank_fields_from_snapshot_archives` read a cached value the attacker already invalidated, so a node with a warm cache commits different state than one that reloaded.
- Invariant to test: Cached and freshly-loaded values are observationally identical at every commit point.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Test the path with the cache primed and cleared; assert the committed state is identical in both runs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy or upgrade a program, or poison the program cache, so honest validators execute different bytecode or produce different results for the same instruction.
