# Q0016: translate_instruction_rust widens instruction privileges (cpi.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `translate_instruction_rust` in `program-runtime/src/cpi.rs` with an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction, and make the writable privileges declared in the transaction message disagree with the privileges the invoke context grants, so that the invariant "Callee privileges are always a subset of the caller's for the same account." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/cpi.rs` -> `translate_instruction_rust()` (around line 538)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction
- Exploit idea: Use `translate_instruction_rust` so the callee sees signer or writable privileges the caller never held, letting an attacker program act on a victim account.
- Invariant to test: Callee privileges are always a subset of the caller's for the same account.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Assert in a test that the callee's `is_signer`/`is_writable` for each account is implied by the parent instruction's.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy a program that reads or writes host/guest memory outside its permitted regions, or forges an account reference, and extracts or corrupts state belonging to other accounts.
