# Q1782: BaseRewardPoolV2.updateFor - early-continue skips a genuine balance change

## Question
In rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol, the userRewardPerTokenPaid == rewardPerToken early-continue treats an unchanged global index as proof that nothing is owed, but balanceOf(account) is read live from MasterMagpie, so a balance that changed while the index stood still is never folded into userRewards. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `updateFor(address _account)` while the staking token is an 18-decimal Wombat receipt token and totalStaked() is far above 1e18, and drive `10**stakingDecimals()` out of agreement with `totalStaked()` - breaking the invariant that userRewards must capture every balance-weighted segment, including segments where the global index did not move - for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol -> `updateFor(address _account)` (mechanism: early-continue skips a genuine balance change)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `updateFor(address _account)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted
- Exploit idea: the userRewardPerTokenPaid == rewardPerToken early-continue treats an unchanged global index as proof that nothing is owed, but balanceOf(account) is read live from MasterMagpie, so a balance that changed while the index stood still is never folded into userRewards. Precondition: the staking token is an 18-decimal Wombat receipt token and totalStaked() is far above 1e18.
- Invariant to test: userRewards must capture every balance-weighted segment, including segments where the global index did not move; concretely, `10**stakingDecimals()` must stay reconciled with `totalStaked()`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the staking token is an 18-decimal Wombat receipt token and totalStaked() is far above 1e18, then assert `10**stakingDecimals()` and `totalStaked()` end identical in both runs.
