# Q3908: login_on_scope_changes: A `shop` param whose scope lookup (`update_access_scopes?`) is ...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `shop` param, `host`, and Referer) reach `login_on_scope_changes / scopes_mismatch? / shop_login` in app/controllers/concerns/shopify_app/shop_access_scopes_verification.rb via GET an action including ShopAccessScopesVerification (legacy strategy), supplying a `shop` param whose scope lookup (`update_access_scopes?`) is done on an attacker domain, forcing a login redirect with attacker host, so that scope checks and the resulting login redirect must be bound to the verified shop, not a raw param is violated, leading to open redirect / cross-shop reauthorization against an attacker store? Specifically confirm that merchant A can never load, write, or act with merchant B's session, token, or scopes.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/concerns/shopify_app/shop_access_scopes_verification.rb — `login_on_scope_changes / scopes_mismatch? / shop_login`
- Entrypoint: GET an action including ShopAccessScopesVerification (legacy strategy)
- Attacker controls: the `shop` param, `host`, and Referer — specifically a `shop` param whose scope lookup (`update_access_scopes?`) is done on an attacker domain, forcing a login redirect with attacker host.
- Exploit idea: Perform the flow as merchant A while naming shop/user B and confirm no B-scoped data is reachable.
- Invariant to test: scope checks and the resulting login redirect must be bound to the verified shop, not a raw param
- Expected Immunefi impact: open redirect / cross-shop reauthorization against an attacker store (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: two-tenant integration test asserting A's request never loads, writes, or acts with B's session/token.
