# Q3328: NEAR deploy_token callback native versus wrapped registration confusion via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `proof callback for public `deploy_token`` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token_callback` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `native versus wrapped registration confusion` under checks the emitting factory, then calls `deploy_token_internal` using metadata from the validated message, violating `proof-bound metadata must not be replayable or malleable in a way that deploys the wrong token id, wrong decimals, or conflicting mappings`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token_callback`
- Entrypoint: `proof callback for public `deploy_token``
- Attacker controls: decoded `LogMetadata` result, chain kind, token address, metadata contents, and attached deposit
- Exploit idea: Target vault-existence checks, deployed-token caches, origin-chain inference, and custom-minter registration. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: proof-bound metadata must not be replayable or malleable in a way that deploys the wrong token id, wrong decimals, or conflicting mappings
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Flip each classification predicate around existing mappings and assert that deployment and later settlement always preserve the same custody model. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
