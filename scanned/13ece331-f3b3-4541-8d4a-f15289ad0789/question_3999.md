# Q3999: Accept wrong proof/network context in prove_a_block_from_database

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering through broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation so `prove_a_block_from_database` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove context treated as canonical for a deposit and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/header_chain_prover.rs::prove_a_block_from_database
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
