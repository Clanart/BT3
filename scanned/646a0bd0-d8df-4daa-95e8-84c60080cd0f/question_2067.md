# Q2067: Confuse replacement linkage in create_move_to_vault_txhandler

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests so `create_move_to_vault_txhandler` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the emergency-stop transaction that should protect the same deposit to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/builder/transaction/mod.rs::create_move_to_vault_txhandler
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
