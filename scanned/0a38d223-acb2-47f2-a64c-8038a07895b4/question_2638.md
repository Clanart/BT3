# Q2638: Duplicate queue or processing state in calculate_work

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `calculate_work` twice with attacker-controlled the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/header_chain/mod.rs::calculate_work
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
