# Q1042: is-healthy-with-mask via liquidate-multi: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, can an unprivileged attacker make `is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
