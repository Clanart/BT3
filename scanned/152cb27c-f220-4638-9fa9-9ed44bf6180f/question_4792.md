# Q4792: WombatPoolHelperV2.withdraw - withdraw releases the underlying before the stake check runs

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, withdraw() calls IWombatStaking(wombatStaking).withdraw first, which sends the deposit token to msg.sender, and only afterwards calls _unstake, which is the step that actually verifies the caller had that much staked in MasterMagpie. Does `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, so that `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` diverges from `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, the invariant that an entitlement must be verified before the value backing it leaves the protocol is broken, and the result is Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: withdraw releases the underlying before the stake check runs)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity and _minAmount
- Exploit idea: withdraw() calls IWombatStaking(wombatStaking).withdraw first, which sends the deposit token to msg.sender, and only afterwards calls _unstake, which is the step that actually verifies the caller had that much staked in MasterMagpie. Precondition: an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert.
- Invariant to test: an entitlement must be verified before the value backing it leaves the protocol; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, have the attacker run `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` versus `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
