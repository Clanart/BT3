# Q0886: increment via liquidate-redeem: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? `increment` advances the user-id nonce, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
