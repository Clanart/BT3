# Q1699: new: A `shop` that sanitizes to an attacker look-alike so `start_ins...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`shop`, `return_to`, `host`, `top_level`, `embedded`, and the Referer header) reach `new / create / authenticate / start_install / start_oauth` in app/controllers/shopify_app/sessions_controller.rb via GET/POST /login (public, unauthenticated), supplying a `shop` that sanitizes to an attacker look-alike so `start_install` builds an install URL for the wrong store, so that the install/OAuth target store must be the sanitized, attacker-independent shop, and return_to same-origin is violated, leading to OAuth flow initiated against an attacker-chosen store / open redirect on login? Specifically confirm that the full public-route flow yields only a rejection or attacker-own-scope result.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/sessions_controller.rb — `new / create / authenticate / start_install / start_oauth`
- Entrypoint: GET/POST /login (public, unauthenticated)
- Attacker controls: `shop`, `return_to`, `host`, `top_level`, `embedded`, and the Referer header — specifically a `shop` that sanitizes to an attacker look-alike so `start_install` builds an install URL for the wrong store.
- Exploit idea: Run the full public route end-to-end with the crafted input and confirm the real-world outcome is safe.
- Invariant to test: the install/OAuth target store must be the sanitized, attacker-independent shop, and return_to same-origin
- Expected Immunefi impact: OAuth flow initiated against an attacker-chosen store / open redirect on login (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: end-to-end integration test through the real route asserting the attacker outcome is a reject/own-scope only.
