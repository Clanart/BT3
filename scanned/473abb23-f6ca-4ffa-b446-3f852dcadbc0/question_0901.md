# Q901: EVM OmniBridge logMetadata1155 malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public EVM metadata logging for ERC-1155 wrappers` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::logMetadata1155` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity` under maps a `(tokenAddress, tokenId)` pair to a deterministic synthetic address before publishing metadata for multi-token bridging, violating `the deterministic alias for an ERC-1155 asset must be collision-resistant and must never point two distinct underlying assets at one bridge identity`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::logMetadata1155`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM metadata logging for ERC-1155 wrappers`
- Attacker controls: ERC-1155 contract address, token id, deterministic-token alias, and msg.value for extensions
- Exploit idea: Exploit arbitrary token metadata calls, old/new ABI switching, or malformed strings in metadata proofs. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: the deterministic alias for an ERC-1155 asset must be collision-resistant and must never point two distinct underlying assets at one bridge identity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Publish or prove pathological metadata values and assert that downstream deployment and mapping logic still binds to the right remote asset and decimals. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
