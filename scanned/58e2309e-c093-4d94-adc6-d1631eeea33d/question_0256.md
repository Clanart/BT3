# Q256: Accept wrong proof/network context in new_mid_state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context through broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation so `new_mid_state` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/merkle_tree.rs::new_mid_state
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
