# Q3173: Parse a malformed object path in sync_outpoint_observations_via_rpc

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft the `fee_paying_type` choice so `sync_outpoint_observations_via_rpc` parses, hashes, or stores one object while later logic signs, verifies, or settles a meaningfully different one, corrupting the binding between raw transaction bytes and the queued tx-sender metadata and violating the invariant that queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/confirmations.rs::sync_outpoint_observations_via_rpc
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `fee_paying_type` choice
- Exploit idea: parse, hash, or store one object while later logic settles another by crafting the `fee_paying_type` choice
- Invariant to test: queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
