# Q730: Exploit reorg boundary handling in parse_op_return_data

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit reorg timing around reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height so `parse_op_return_data` treats a non-canonical object as canonical long enough to mutate bridge state, corrupting the storage-proof key/value binding used for deposit or withdrawal validation and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/mod.rs::parse_op_return_data
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: reorder or replay reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height across canonical and non-canonical views
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
