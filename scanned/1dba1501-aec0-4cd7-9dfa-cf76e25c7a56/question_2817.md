# Q2817: Starknet fin_transfer final settlement and later fee claim can diverge via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Starknet settlement entrypoint` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::fin_transfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `final settlement and later fee claim can diverge` under checks pause flags, enforces `!is_transfer_finalised(destination_nonce)`, marks the nonce finalised, verifies the signed Borsh payload, and then releases native or bridge-token value, violating `a signed inbound settlement must never be replayable, branch-switchable, or capable of failing after finalisation state changes in a way that strands or duplicates funds`?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::fin_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet settlement entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: signature fields, destination nonce, origin chain, origin nonce, token address, amount, recipient, fee recipient, and message
- Exploit idea: Target differences between settle-time denormalization and claim-time recomputation of fee, dust, or relayer substitution. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: a signed inbound settlement must never be replayable, branch-switchable, or capable of failing after finalisation state changes in a way that strands or duplicates funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Compare settled principal, stored transfer record, and fee-claim proof under edge amounts and assert that the three always reconstruct one consistent event. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
