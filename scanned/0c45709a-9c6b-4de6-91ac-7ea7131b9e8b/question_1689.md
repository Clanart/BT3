# Q1689: NEAR verify_proof wrapper missing chain or contract domain separation through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `internal proof-dispatch helper reached from public `fin_transfer`, `claim_fee`, `deploy_token`, and `bind_token`` with control over chain kind, prover args bytes, and the choice of configured prover contract and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::verify_proof` from the adjacent proof parsing and source authentication that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `missing chain or contract domain separation` attack class because routes proof bytes to the chain-specific prover stored in `provers` and returns the promise used by higher-level bridge flows, violating `every proof-consuming public flow must stay bound to the intended prover, source chain, and proof kind so attackers cannot cross-wire verifier domains`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::verify_proof`
- Entrypoint: `internal proof-dispatch helper reached from public `fin_transfer`, `claim_fee`, `deploy_token`, and `bind_token``
- Attacker controls: chain kind, prover args bytes, and the choice of configured prover contract
- Exploit idea: Target validators keyed by derived signer, block hash, emitter address, or payload bytes that omit some domain field. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent proof parsing and source authentication.
- Invariant to test: every proof-consuming public flow must stay bound to the intended prover, source chain, and proof kind so attackers cannot cross-wire verifier domains
- Expected Immunefi impact: Light client verification bypass
- Fast validation: Attempt cross-chain and cross-contract replay of the same validated bytes and assert that every trust domain field participates in acceptance. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::verify_proof` and the adjacent proof parsing and source authentication after every branch.
