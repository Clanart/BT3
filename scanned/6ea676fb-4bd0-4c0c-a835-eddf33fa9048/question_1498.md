# Q1498: receive: A `:type` value that maps to an unintended registered webhook h...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `:type` route segment, the raw body, and all webhook headers) reach `receive` in app/controllers/shopify_app/webhooks_controller.rb via POST /webhooks/:type, supplying a `:type` value that maps to an unintended registered webhook handler, so that no webhook side effect may run before HMAC verification succeeds over the raw body is violated, leading to forged webhook processing (unauthorized state change)? Specifically confirm that the strongest verified identity source wins; a weaker channel cannot override it.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/webhooks_controller.rb — `receive`
- Entrypoint: POST /webhooks/:type
- Attacker controls: the `:type` route segment, the raw body, and all webhook headers — specifically a `:type` value that maps to an unintended registered webhook handler.
- Exploit idea: Send the identity/token via the unexpected channel (URL param vs Authorization header vs cookie) and compare handling.
- Invariant to test: no webhook side effect may run before HMAC verification succeeds over the raw body
- Expected Immunefi impact: forged webhook processing (unauthorized state change) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: test asserting header, URL-param, and cookie sources cannot be mixed to supply a weaker/attacker token.
