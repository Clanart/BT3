# Q1440: WombatBribeManager.vote - getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown

## Question
In wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` while the attacker locks vlMGP, votes and casts inside a single transaction, and drive `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` out of agreement with `totalVlMgpInVote` - breaking the invariant that the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance - for Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` (mechanism: getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries
- Exploit idea: getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Precondition: the attacker locks vlMGP, votes and casts inside a single transaction.
- Invariant to test: the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance; concretely, `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` must stay reconciled with `totalVlMgpInVote`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the attacker locks vlMGP, votes and casts inside a single transaction, snapshot `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` and `totalVlMgpInVote`, run the attacker's `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
