# Q1440: from_order_independent_p2sh: order-independent multisig field order changes executed set not digest

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `from_order_independent_p2sh` (in `stacks-codec/src/transaction.rs`) via a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions), such that reordering auth fields changes the authorised key set but not the sighash, breaking the invariant that the key set authenticated == the key set the digest commits — leading to multisig manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: `stacks-codec/src/transaction.rs` -> `from_order_independent_p2sh`
- Entrypoint: a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions)
- Attacker controls: the full auth structure (singlesig/multisig/order-independent/sponsored), nonce, fee, chain id, version, payload, and post-condition list, plus mutation of their own signed transactions
- Exploit idea: reordering auth fields changes the authorised key set but not the sighash
- Invariant to test: the key set authenticated == the key set the digest commits
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - multisig manipulation
- Fast validation: test a reordered auth-field set
