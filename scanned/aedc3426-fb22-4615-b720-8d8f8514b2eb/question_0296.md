# Q296: NEAR NativeFeeRestricted gating fee and principal split divergence via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `ft_on_transfer` path for outbound transfers` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer storage-owner logic` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `fee and principal split divergence` under permits or denies native-fee funding during outbound init depending on the signer’s `NativeFeeRestricted` role and storage-balance state, violating `role-gated native-fee rules must not let an unprivileged caller smuggle native-fee liabilities into another storage owner or bypass intended restrictions`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer storage-owner logic`
- Entrypoint: `public `ft_on_transfer` path for outbound transfers`
- Attacker controls: signer role membership, native fee, storage balance, and resume timing
- Exploit idea: Focus on branches where fee checks happen before normalization, denormalization, callback resolution, or storage billing. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: role-gated native-fee rules must not let an unprivileged caller smuggle native-fee liabilities into another storage owner or bypass intended restrictions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Fuzz amount/fee/native-fee edge cases around zero, max, and decimal boundaries and assert that emitted value plus stored fee always equals consumed value. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
