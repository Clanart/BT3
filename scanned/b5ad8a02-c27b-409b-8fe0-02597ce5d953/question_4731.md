# Q4731: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - _minimumLiquidity is caller-supplied on the deposit leg

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: deposit() and depositNative() forward the caller's _minimumLiquidity into the Wombat deposit, so a caller can accept a deposit that mints far less LP than fair while the receipt mint is taken from the resulting delta. Under an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, is there an unprivileged sequence of `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` that leaves `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` unreconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`, violates the invariant that a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded, and delivers Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: _minimumLiquidity is caller-supplied on the deposit leg)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: deposit() and depositNative() forward the caller's _minimumLiquidity into the Wombat deposit, so a caller can accept a deposit that mints far less LP than fair while the receipt mint is taken from the resulting delta. Precondition: an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert.
- Invariant to test: a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, then assert `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` end identical in both runs.
