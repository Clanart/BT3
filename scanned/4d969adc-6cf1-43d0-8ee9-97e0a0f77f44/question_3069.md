# Q3069: current_shopify_session_id: An `id_token` whose signature is invalid but still parses, prob...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params) reach `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb via GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy, supplying an `id_token` whose signature is invalid but still parses, probing whether session_id is derived before verification, so that token exchange must not persist a session for a shop asserted only by an unverified claim is violated, leading to unauthorized offline access-token acquisition (token theft)? Specifically confirm that the error/rescue branch fails closed and leaks no token or secret.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb — `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange`
- Entrypoint: GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params — specifically an `id_token` whose signature is invalid but still parses, probing whether session_id is derived before verification.
- Exploit idea: Force the rescued/exception branch and confirm it fails closed without leaking secrets or granting a session.
- Invariant to test: token exchange must not persist a session for a shop asserted only by an unverified claim
- Expected Immunefi impact: unauthorized offline access-token acquisition (token theft) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: error-injection test asserting the rescue branch yields no session, no token, and no secret in the response/log.
