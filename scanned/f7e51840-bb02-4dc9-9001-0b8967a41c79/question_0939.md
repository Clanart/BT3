# Q939: NEAR omni-types EVM header parser parser boundary or offset manipulation via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public EVM proof path through `verify_proof`` and then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint so that `near/omni-types/src/evm/header.rs::BlockHeader` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `parser boundary or offset manipulation` under decodes block headers that underpin receipt-proof verification, violating `header parsing must not accept malformed or cross-fork data that still drives a valid-looking receipt proof toward bridge settlement`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-types/src/evm/header.rs::BlockHeader`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM proof path through `verify_proof``
- Attacker controls: RLP-encoded header bytes and all decoded header fields including receipts root and hash presence
- Exploit idea: Attack offset arithmetic, length prefixes, bucket indices, or body slicing in proof decoders. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: header parsing must not accept malformed or cross-fork data that still drives a valid-looking receipt proof toward bridge settlement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Light client verification bypass
- Fast validation: Fuzz minimal, maximal, and malformed lengths and assert that every accepted proof round-trips into exactly the intended structured fields. Then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
