# Q1319: Exploit replacement logic in try_to_send_unconfirmed_txs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the `activate_outpoints` / `activate_txids` dependency lists so `try_to_send_unconfirmed_txs` constructs a replacement path that copies the wrong witnesses, inputs, or fee logic, corrupting the fee-payer UTXO chain selected for CPFP/RBF and violating the invariant that RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent, leading to Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/lib.rs::try_to_send_unconfirmed_txs
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `activate_outpoints` / `activate_txids` dependency lists
- Exploit idea: copy the wrong witnesses, inputs, or fee logic by shaping the `activate_outpoints` / `activate_txids` dependency lists
- Invariant to test: RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
