# Q781: prepare_entry_batch account-size meter wrap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `prepare_entry_batch` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transaction ordering, duplicated accounts, address lookup tables, and batched conflicting write sets such that account-size or memory-region arithmetic may wrap, saturate, or truncate on attacker-chosen boundaries, breaking the invariant that size meters and offsets must match true account memory bounds and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::prepare_entry_batch
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transaction ordering, duplicated accounts, address lookup tables, and batched conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: search for silent integer boundary behavior in size/accounting code
- Invariant to test: size meters and offsets must match true account memory bounds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: hit the largest legal account sizes and offset combinations
