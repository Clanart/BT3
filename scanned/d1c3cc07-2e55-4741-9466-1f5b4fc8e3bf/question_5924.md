# Q5924: resolve-callcode via liquidate: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `debt-amount` reach `resolve-callcode` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349) in a state where it satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? Given that it chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349` -> `resolve-callcode`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Reach it through `liquidate` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `debt-amount` varied, and assert that the value `resolve-callcode` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
