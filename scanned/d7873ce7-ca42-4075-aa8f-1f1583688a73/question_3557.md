# Q3557: Drive state split inside host_journal_hash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation with crafted Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents so `host_journal_hash` updates one canonical value while another subsystem retains the older one for the same event, corrupting the canonical header-chain state and total work and breaking the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/structs.rs::host_journal_hash
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Exploit idea: update one canonical value while another subsystem keeps the old one for the same event via Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
