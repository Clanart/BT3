# Q3909: Solana DeployToken initialize_token_metadata low-half deploy salt aliases another token id via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public deploy flow through `deploy_token`` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/deploy_token.rs::initialize_token_metadata` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `low-half deploy salt aliases another token id` under hashes overlong token strings to derive mint seeds, caps decimals, writes Metaplex metadata, and posts a `DeployTokenResponse` back to Near, violating `mint-seed derivation, decimal capping, and metadata writes must produce one canonical wrapped token per signed remote asset`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/deploy_token.rs::initialize_token_metadata`
- Entrypoint: `public deploy flow through `deploy_token``
- Attacker controls: token string bytes, name, symbol, decimals, payer funding, and metadata PDA seeds
- Exploit idea: Target Starknet deployment where the full token-id hash is the map key but only the low portion becomes the deploy salt. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: mint-seed derivation, decimal capping, and metadata writes must produce one canonical wrapped token per signed remote asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Search for colliding low-half salts and assert that address derivation remains unique for all deployable token ids. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
