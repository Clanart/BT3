# Q2588: mark_slot_frozen slow-consumer retention

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `mark_slot_frozen` by submit transactions that maximize write churn near slot boundaries with heavy write churn near slot-freeze boundaries so that one slow subscriber can make state created around this function accumulate without bound, breaking the invariant that one slow subscriber must not create unbounded retained notification state and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::mark_slot_frozen
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that maximize write churn near slot boundaries
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn near slot-freeze boundaries
- Exploit idea: treat queue retention as the bug class
- Invariant to test: one slow subscriber must not create unbounded retained notification state
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: stop reading from one websocket and monitor retained notification memory
