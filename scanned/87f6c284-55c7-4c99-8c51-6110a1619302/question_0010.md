# Q10: Purchase-Message Misbinding With Duplicate Or Reordered Items

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `HandlerV2.handlePostRequests(IHost host, request) -> BandwidthManager.onAccept` with attacker-controlled purchase parameters, app and chain bytes, authenticated inbound purchase or governance messages, and fee-token decimals and placing duplicate or reordered leaves, signatures, requests, responses, timeouts, or commitments inside one user-accessible batch, and make `onAccept` apply a privileged purchase, tier update, or withdrawal action from the wrong source module so `the trusted source of bandwidth governance or purchase messages` becomes inconsistent with `the exact Hyperbridge module that is allowed to issue that action`, breaking the invariant that cross-chain bandwidth actions must authenticate both source chain and source module before changing credit or withdrawing assets and leading to Critical: unauthenticated cross-chain governance or host-management execution?

## Target
- File/function: evm/src/apps/BandwidthManager.sol::onAccept
- Entrypoint: HandlerV2.handlePostRequests(IHost host, request) -> BandwidthManager.onAccept
- Attacker controls: purchase parameters, app and chain bytes, authenticated inbound purchase or governance messages, and fee-token decimals
- Exploit idea: Apply a privileged purchase, tier update, or withdrawal action from the wrong source module. Use a batch with one honest item and one duplicated or reordered item to see whether unique-item assumptions collapse.
- Invariant to test: cross-chain bandwidth actions must authenticate both source chain and source module before changing credit or withdrawing assets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: unauthenticated cross-chain governance or host-management execution.
- Fast validation: Route a valid-looking message from the wrong Hyperbridge source module and assert no tier change, withdrawal, or credit mutation occurs. Write a focused batch test with repeated indices or commitments and assert only unique authenticated items can affect state.
