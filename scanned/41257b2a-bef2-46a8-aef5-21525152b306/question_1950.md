# Q1950: mask-to-list-collateral via collateral-remove: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `mask-to-list-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
