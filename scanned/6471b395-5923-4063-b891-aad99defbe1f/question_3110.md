# Q3110: Starknet deploy_token hashed or padded seed collision at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Starknet deploy-token entrypoint` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token` violate `one signed metadata payload must deploy exactly one bridge token with one stable token-id mapping and decimal model` in the `hashed or padded seed collision` attack class because checks pause flags, verifies a Borsh payload signature, hashes the token id, computes a deploy salt, deploys a bridge token, and writes bidirectional mappings becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet deploy-token entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: signature fields, token id `ByteArray`, name, symbol, decimals, and current class hash
- Exploit idea: Target hashed token strings, low-half salts, and deterministic-address truncation. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: one signed metadata payload must deploy exactly one bridge token with one stable token-id mapping and decimal model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Search the seed space for collisions and assert that every derivation function preserves uniqueness of remote asset identity. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
