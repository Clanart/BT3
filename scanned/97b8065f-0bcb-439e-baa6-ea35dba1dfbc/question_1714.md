# Q1714: write_packed_storages can be driven into unbounded work (ancient_append_vecs.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `write_packed_storages` in `accounts-db/src/ancient_append_vecs.rs` with state that is committed on one fork and then observed from another, and make `write_packed_storages` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `write_packed_storages` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/ancient_append_vecs.rs` -> `write_packed_storages()` (around line 646)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: state that is committed on one fork and then observed from another
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `write_packed_storages` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `write_packed_storages` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `write_packed_storages` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft bytecode, ELF metadata, precompile data, or zk proof input that panics, aborts, infinite-loops, or exhausts memory inside the VM and halts every validator.
