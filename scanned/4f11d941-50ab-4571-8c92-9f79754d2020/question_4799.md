# Q4799: resolve-price-feed via collateral-add: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`resolve-price-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332) dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:332` -> `resolve-price-feed`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `resolve-price-feed` dispatches on a 1-byte type to `resolve-pyth` or `resolve-dia`, erroring otherwise. Reach it through `collateral-add` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
