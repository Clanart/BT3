# Q2595: Duplicate queue or processing state in verify_tar_image_digest_inspect_only

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `verify_tar_image_digest_inspect_only` twice with attacker-controlled the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove context treated as canonical for a deposit and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/docker.rs::verify_tar_image_digest_inspect_only
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
