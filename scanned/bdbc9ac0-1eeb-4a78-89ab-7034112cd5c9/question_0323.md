# Q0323: is-liquidation-paused via liquidate-multi: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`is-liquidation-paused` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:691) returns true if the manual pause, the GLOBAL grace entry, OR the per-asset grace entry is live. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:691` -> `is-liquidation-paused`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `is-liquidation-paused` returns true if the manual pause, the GLOBAL grace entry, OR the per-asset grace entry is live. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
