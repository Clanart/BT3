# Q1307: next-index via supply-collateral-add: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
