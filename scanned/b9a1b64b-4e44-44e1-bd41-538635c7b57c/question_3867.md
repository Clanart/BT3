# Q3867: NEAR process_fin_transfer_to_other_chain fee recipient can be substituted or reclaimed by attacker via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `internal path reached from public `fin_transfer` for non-Near recipients` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::process_fin_transfer_to_other_chain` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `fee recipient can be substituted or reclaimed by attacker` under marks the transfer finalised, unlocks origin-side liquidity, re-locks destination-side fee or amount, optionally sends the fast-transfer payout to a relayer, or stores a new pending transfer for the next chain, violating `cross-chain forwarding must never let one verified inbound event release value locally and also create a second valid outbound claim with inconsistent lock accounting`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::process_fin_transfer_to_other_chain`
- Entrypoint: `internal path reached from public `fin_transfer` for non-Near recipients`
- Attacker controls: recipient chain, predecessor account, transfer message, fast-transfer status, and token origin chain
- Exploit idea: Target optional fee-recipient fields, predecessor-captured identities, and relayer substitution on fast paths. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: cross-chain forwarding must never let one verified inbound event release value locally and also create a second valid outbound claim with inconsistent lock accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Settle and claim with varied fee-recipient encodings and assert that only the intended recipient can ever collect that fee. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
