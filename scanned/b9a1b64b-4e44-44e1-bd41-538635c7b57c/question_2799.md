# Q2799: EVM ENearProxy burn migration swap leaves old and new claims live via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public bridge-side burn path behind `MINTER_ROLE` but used by outbound bridge flows` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `evm/src/eNear/contracts/ENearProxy.sol::burn` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `migration swap leaves old and new claims live` under calls `eNear.transferToNear` after asserting the token address is the configured eNEAR token, violating `legacy outbound burns must not let attackers create Near-side withdrawal claims without consuming the exact on-chain eNEAR balance once`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/eNear/contracts/ENearProxy.sol::burn`
- Entrypoint: `public bridge-side burn path behind `MINTER_ROLE` but used by outbound bridge flows`
- Attacker controls: token address and amount
- Exploit idea: Target old/new token migration flows that combine bridge burning and replacement minting. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: legacy outbound burns must not let attackers create Near-side withdrawal claims without consuming the exact on-chain eNEAR balance once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Track both token supplies and pending transfer state and assert that migrating one unit cannot leave two redeemable claims. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
