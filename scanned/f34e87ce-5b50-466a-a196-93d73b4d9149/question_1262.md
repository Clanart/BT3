# Q1262: collect_balances signature-cache inconsistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `collect_balances` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transactions that resize accounts, trigger cpi, and partially fail after touching many balances such that a signature can become cached or cleared in a way that disagrees with actual execution or rollback outcome, breaking the invariant that signature caches must reflect executed and committed reality only and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::collect_balances
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transactions that resize accounts, trigger CPI, and partially fail after touching many balances
- Exploit idea: look for cache mutations on paths that later fail or retry
- Invariant to test: signature caches must reflect executed and committed reality only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace signature-cache updates while forcing retries, conflicts, and late failures
