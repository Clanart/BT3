# Q3437: NEAR public proof-kind multiplexing shared proof response reused across entrypoints via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public proof-submission entrypoints` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fin_transfer/claim_fee/deploy_token/bind_token using shared verifier outputs` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `shared proof response reused across entrypoints` under multiple public bridge entrypoints trust the same verifier envelope and then downcast to different `ProverResult` variants, violating `one validated proof must not be reusable across public bridge entrypoints whose economic effects differ, even if they share the same outer verifier contract`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fin_transfer/claim_fee/deploy_token/bind_token using shared verifier outputs`
- Entrypoint: `public proof-submission entrypoints`
- Attacker controls: proof kind, source chain, and bytes that a prover returns as `ProverResult`
- Exploit idea: Attack systems where one verifier contract serves deploy, finalize, metadata, and fee-claim flows with a shared result type. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: one validated proof must not be reusable across public bridge entrypoints whose economic effects differ, even if they share the same outer verifier contract
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Attempt to route accepted verifier outputs into every public proof consumer and assert that each entrypoint only accepts its intended result variant and source semantics. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
