# Q2823: NEAR omni-types EVM header parser address normalization changes authenticated subject via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public EVM proof path through `verify_proof`` and then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint so that `near/omni-types/src/evm/header.rs::BlockHeader` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `address normalization changes authenticated subject` under decodes block headers that underpin receipt-proof verification, violating `header parsing must not accept malformed or cross-fork data that still drives a valid-looking receipt proof toward bridge settlement`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-types/src/evm/header.rs::BlockHeader`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM proof path through `verify_proof``
- Attacker controls: RLP-encoded header bytes and all decoded header fields including receipts root and hash presence
- Exploit idea: Target hex, byte-array, and account-id conversions between proof parsing and token/recipient lookup. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: header parsing must not accept malformed or cross-fork data that still drives a valid-looking receipt proof toward bridge settlement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Round-trip every proof-derived address through all local conversions and assert that normalization never changes the bridge subject. Then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
