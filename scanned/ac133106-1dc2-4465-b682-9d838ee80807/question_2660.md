# Q2660: Solana init_transfer native versus wrapped branch switch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker choose inputs to `public Solana `init_transfer` instruction` that make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer` classify the asset differently before and after a custody-changing step through charges native fee into the SOL vault, either transfers native custody into the vault or burns bridged supply, and posts a Near-bound message, violating `one outbound Solana transfer must consume exactly the asset and fee implied by the emitted message and must not let native-vault and bridged-burn branches diverge`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `init_transfer` instruction`
- Attacker controls: mint, source token account, optional vault, user signer, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, and message
- Exploit idea: Target zero-address, deployed-token, custom-minter, native-vault, or bridge-token branch predicates.
- Invariant to test: one outbound Solana transfer must consume exactly the asset and fee implied by the emitted message and must not let native-vault and bridged-burn branches diverge
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each branch predicate to flip around callbacks or mapping writes and assert that the same source asset can never produce two incompatible custody models.
