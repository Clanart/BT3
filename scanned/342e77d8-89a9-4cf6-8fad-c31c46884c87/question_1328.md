# Q1328: send-underlying via liquidate-redeem: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `send-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296` -> `send-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed varied, and assert that the value `send-underlying` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
