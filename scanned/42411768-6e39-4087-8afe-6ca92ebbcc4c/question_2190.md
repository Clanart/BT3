# Q2190: hmac_valid?: A base64 HMAC with different padding/whitespace than `strict_en...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the raw request body, the X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header) reach `hmac_valid? / shopify_hmac` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/payload_verification.rb via POST /webhooks/:type (WebhooksController) and the extension verification controller, supplying a base64 HMAC with different padding/whitespace than `strict_encode64` output to probe the comparison, so that a missing or malformed HMAC header must fail closed is violated, leading to authentication bypass on the webhook endpoint? Specifically confirm that no protected state is reachable by skipping or repeating an auth step.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/payload_verification.rb — `hmac_valid? / shopify_hmac`
- Entrypoint: POST /webhooks/:type (WebhooksController) and the extension verification controller
- Attacker controls: the raw request body, the X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header — specifically a base64 HMAC with different padding/whitespace than `strict_encode64` output to probe the comparison.
- Exploit idea: Walk the auth state machine out of order (skip/repeat a step) and confirm no step can be reached unauthenticated.
- Invariant to test: a missing or malformed HMAC header must fail closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: authentication bypass on the webhook endpoint (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: state-machine test exercising out-of-order transitions and asserting each protected state still requires verification.
