# Q121: Keeper.EVMBlockConfig - Basefee Defaults To Zero When London Active But Feemarket Param Nil

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call a malicious contract from an unprivileged EOA through `per-block EVM config construction for transaction execution` while controlling `value` and `access list`, under the precondition that a post-processing hook is configured in production and can fail, drive `ApplyMessageWithConfig -> Prepare -> EVM CALL/CREATE -> gas/refund calculation -> StateDB.Commit` in `x/evm/keeper/config.go::Keeper.EVMBlockConfig` so that baseFee defaults to zero when London active but feemarket param nil, violating the invariant that nonce, contract address, logs, bloom, receipts, and gas must match go-ethereum semantics, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/config.go::Keeper.EVMBlockConfig`
- Entrypoint: `per-block EVM config construction for transaction execution`
- Attacker controls: `value`, `access list`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: baseFee defaults to zero when London active but feemarket param nil through `ApplyMessageWithConfig -> Prepare -> EVM CALL/CREATE -> gas/refund calculation -> StateDB.Commit`.
- Invariant to test: nonce, contract address, logs, bloom, receipts, and gas must match go-ethereum semantics.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: run a local integration test that submits the crafted raw tx through JSON-RPC and compares committed state with direct keeper queries.
