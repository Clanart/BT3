# Q2376: clean_accounts root-flush visibility gap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `clean_accounts` by submit transactions that create, drain, resize, and recreate many accounts with high-churn account creation/close patterns and repeated zero-lamport transitions so that root advancement and flush state can diverge long enough for readers to observe impossible account histories, breaking the invariant that root visibility and flushed persistence must not diverge in externally observable ways and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::clean_accounts
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that create, drain, resize, and recreate many accounts
- Attacker controls: high-churn account creation/close patterns and repeated zero-lamport transitions
- Exploit idea: search for split-brain visibility between rooted and flushed state
- Invariant to test: root visibility and flushed persistence must not diverge in externally observable ways
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: read the same pubkey during root movement and compare rooted versus cached answers
