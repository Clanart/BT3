# Q1822: Airdrop2.claim - period count truncates so a whole interval can be lost

## Question
rewards/Airdrop2.sol: vested folds in (block.timestamp - startVestingTime) / intervals as an integer count before multiplying, so value accrues in discrete jumps and a claim placed just before a boundary permanently locks in the lower figure for the amount claimed. Under the claimant sets isLock to true so the vlMGP lock leg runs, is there an unprivileged sequence of `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)` that leaves `vestingPeriodCount and intervals` unreconciled with `the elapsed period count`, violates the invariant that a vesting curve must not permanently penalise a claim placed near a period boundary, and delivers High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/Airdrop2.sol -> `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)` (mechanism: period count truncates so a whole interval can be lost)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: totalAmount and merkleProof for any leaf that verifies against the root, plus isLock and the claim timing
- Exploit idea: vested folds in (block.timestamp - startVestingTime) / intervals as an integer count before multiplying, so value accrues in discrete jumps and a claim placed just before a boundary permanently locks in the lower figure for the amount claimed. Precondition: the claimant sets isLock to true so the vlMGP lock leg runs.
- Invariant to test: a vesting curve must not permanently penalise a claim placed near a period boundary; concretely, `vestingPeriodCount and intervals` must stay reconciled with `the elapsed period count`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)`: constrain the setup so that the claimant sets isLock to true so the vlMGP lock leg runs, fuzz the attacker inputs (totalAmount and merkleProof for any leaf that verifies against the root, plus isLock and the claim timing), and assert after every call that a vesting curve must not permanently penalise a claim placed near a period boundary.
