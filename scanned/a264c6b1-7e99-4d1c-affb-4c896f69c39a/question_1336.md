# Q1336: find-collateral-amount via collateral-remove-redeem: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-underlying` reach `find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `min-underlying`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
