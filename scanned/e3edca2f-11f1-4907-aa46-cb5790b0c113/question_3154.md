# Q3154: Starknet bridge-token upgrade coupling native versus wrapped registration confusion at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public bridge activity that depends on upgraded token implementations` with boundary-controlled inputs covering zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and make `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::upgrade_token plus bridge_token.cairo::upgrade` violate `public bridge flows must not become exploitable through an implementation mismatch that changes supply semantics for already-mapped tokens` in the `native versus wrapped registration confusion` attack class because bridge token upgrades are admin-gated, but public settlement and outbound flows depend on the assumption that token logic before and after upgrade preserves burn/mint invariants becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::upgrade_token plus bridge_token.cairo::upgrade`
- Entrypoint: `public bridge activity that depends on upgraded token implementations`
- Attacker controls: token address chosen from the bridge map and any transfer state that spans pre/post upgrade token classes
- Exploit idea: Target vault-existence checks, deployed-token caches, origin-chain inference, and custom-minter registration. Concentrate on zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values.
- Invariant to test: public bridge flows must not become exploitable through an implementation mismatch that changes supply semantics for already-mapped tokens
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Flip each classification predicate around existing mappings and assert that deployment and later settlement always preserve the same custody model. Sweep boundary values for zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
