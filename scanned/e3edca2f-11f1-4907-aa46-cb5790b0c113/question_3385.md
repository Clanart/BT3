# Q3385: Starknet deploy_token endianness mismatch forks authenticated bytes via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Starknet deploy-token entrypoint` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `endianness mismatch forks authenticated bytes` under checks pause flags, verifies a Borsh payload signature, hashes the token id, computes a deploy salt, deploys a bridge token, and writes bidirectional mappings, violating `one signed metadata payload must deploy exactly one bridge token with one stable token-id mapping and decimal model`?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet deploy-token entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: signature fields, token id `ByteArray`, name, symbol, decimals, and current class hash
- Exploit idea: Target Borsh helpers and hand-built payload encoders across Rust, Solidity, and Cairo. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: one signed metadata payload must deploy exactly one bridge token with one stable token-id mapping and decimal model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Cross-generate payloads on every implementation and assert byte-for-byte equality for every field combination that can reach signatures or proofs. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
