# Q5813: WombatBribeManager.castVotes - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `castVotes(bool swapForBnb)` under the victim has a large unsettled balance in the pool rewarder and force `totalVlMgpInVote` apart from `sum of userTotalVotedInVlmgp over all voters`, breaking the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates for Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `castVotes(bool swapForBnb)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `castVotes(bool swapForBnb)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the exact block at which every pending vote is pushed to Wombat and every bribe is harvested, plus the caller fee destination
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the victim has a large unsettled balance in the pool rewarder.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `totalVlMgpInVote` must stay reconciled with `sum of userTotalVotedInVlmgp over all voters`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (the exact block at which every pending vote is pushed to Wombat and every bribe is harvested, plus the caller fee destination) under the victim has a large unsettled balance in the pool rewarder, asserting on every row that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates.
