# Q376: Desync metadata inside calculate_target_fee_rate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit the `rbf_signing_info` object through public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction so `calculate_target_fee_rate` stores or uses metadata that describes a different intent than the raw transaction/proof it later sends, corrupting the fee-payer UTXO chain selected for CPFP/RBF and violating the invariant that RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent, leading to Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/lib.rs::calculate_target_fee_rate
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `rbf_signing_info` object
- Exploit idea: make raw bytes and persisted metadata describe different intents using the `rbf_signing_info` object
- Invariant to test: RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
