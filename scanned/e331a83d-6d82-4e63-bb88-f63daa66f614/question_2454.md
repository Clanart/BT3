# Q2454: verify_request: A request ordering issue where `head(:unauthorized)` is set but...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the raw body and X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header) reach `verify_request` in app/controllers/shopify_app/extension_verification_controller.rb via POST to any controller subclassing ExtensionVerificationController, supplying a request ordering issue where `head(:unauthorized)` is set but execution continues (note the head-before-log ordering), so that extension requests must be rejected before any action body runs when HMAC is invalid is violated, leading to forged extension request accepted (auth bypass)? Specifically confirm that the gem's canonical form matches Shopify's signed canonical form exactly.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/extension_verification_controller.rb — `verify_request`
- Entrypoint: POST to any controller subclassing ExtensionVerificationController
- Attacker controls: the raw body and X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header — specifically a request ordering issue where `head(:unauthorized)` is set but execution continues (note the head-before-log ordering).
- Exploit idea: Probe whether the gem's canonical form of shop/host/params matches Shopify's exact canonicalization.
- Invariant to test: extension requests must be rejected before any action body runs when HMAC is invalid
- Expected Immunefi impact: forged extension request accepted (auth bypass) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: canonicalization test comparing the gem's normalized string to Shopify's signed canonical form byte-for-byte.
