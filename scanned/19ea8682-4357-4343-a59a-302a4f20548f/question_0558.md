# Q0558: ubalance via collateral-remove-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `receiver` for the underlying leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `ubalance` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303` -> `ubalance`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver` for the underlying leg across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `ubalance` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
