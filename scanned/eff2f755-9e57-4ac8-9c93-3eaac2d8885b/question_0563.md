# Q0563: uint-to-list-u64 via liquidate: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
`uint-to-list-u64` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80) expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, use that to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80` -> `uint-to-list-u64`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `uint-to-list-u64` expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Reach it through `liquidate` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
