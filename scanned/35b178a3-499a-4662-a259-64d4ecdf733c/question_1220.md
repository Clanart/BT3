# Q1220: Exploit ordering assumptions in apply_block_headers

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use attacker-controlled the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof so `apply_block_headers` validates the right inputs in the wrong order, corrupting the storage-proof key/value binding used for deposit or withdrawal validation and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/header_chain/mod.rs::apply_block_headers
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Exploit idea: validate the right pieces in the wrong order using the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
