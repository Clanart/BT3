# Q1652: process_instruction signature-cache inconsistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_instruction` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with versioned messages, duplicate accounts, alt expansion, and cpi-heavy instruction graphs such that a signature can become cached or cleared in a way that disagrees with actual execution or rollback outcome, breaking the invariant that signature caches must reflect executed and committed reality only and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs::process_instruction
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, duplicate accounts, ALT expansion, and CPI-heavy instruction graphs
- Exploit idea: look for cache mutations on paths that later fail or retry
- Invariant to test: signature caches must reflect executed and committed reality only
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace signature-cache updates while forcing retries, conflicts, and late failures
