# Q3656: Starknet fin_transfer fee recipient can be substituted or reclaimed by attacker at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Starknet settlement entrypoint` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::fin_transfer` violate `a signed inbound settlement must never be replayable, branch-switchable, or capable of failing after finalisation state changes in a way that strands or duplicates funds` in the `fee recipient can be substituted or reclaimed by attacker` attack class because checks pause flags, enforces `!is_transfer_finalised(destination_nonce)`, marks the nonce finalised, verifies the signed Borsh payload, and then releases native or bridge-token value becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::fin_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet settlement entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: signature fields, destination nonce, origin chain, origin nonce, token address, amount, recipient, fee recipient, and message
- Exploit idea: Target optional fee-recipient fields, predecessor-captured identities, and relayer substitution on fast paths. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: a signed inbound settlement must never be replayable, branch-switchable, or capable of failing after finalisation state changes in a way that strands or duplicates funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Settle and claim with varied fee-recipient encodings and assert that only the intended recipient can ever collect that fee. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
