# Q4046: mWOMSVBaseRewarder.getRewards - dust threshold waives the forfeit entirely

## Question
rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol: _calExpireForfeit() sets forfeitAmount to zero whenever it is below _amount / 1000, so any settlement whose computed forfeit lands under one tenth of a percent is paid out in full. Under the attacker locks one block before a known large settlement and unlocks one block after, is there an unprivileged sequence of `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` that leaves `balanceOf(account)` unreconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`, violates the invariant that a rounding convenience must not create a settlement size at which the forfeit rule stops applying, and delivers High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: dust threshold waives the forfeit entirely)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: _calExpireForfeit() sets forfeitAmount to zero whenever it is below _amount / 1000, so any settlement whose computed forfeit lands under one tenth of a percent is paid out in full. Precondition: the attacker locks one block before a known large settlement and unlocks one block after.
- Invariant to test: a rounding convenience must not create a settlement size at which the forfeit rule stops applying; concretely, `balanceOf(account)` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the attacker locks one block before a known large settlement and unlocks one block after, snapshot `balanceOf(account)` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,account).staked`, run the attacker's `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
