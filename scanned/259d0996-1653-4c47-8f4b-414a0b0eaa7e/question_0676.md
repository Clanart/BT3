# Q0676: accrue-collateral-asset via accrue: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block reach `accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `accrue` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
