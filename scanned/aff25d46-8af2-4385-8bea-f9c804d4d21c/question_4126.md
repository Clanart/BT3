# Q4126: WombatPoolHelperV2.deposit - receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Does `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, so that `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` diverges from `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`, the invariant that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution is broken, and the result is Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Precondition: the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body.
- Invariant to test: the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, call `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, and assert `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` equals `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
