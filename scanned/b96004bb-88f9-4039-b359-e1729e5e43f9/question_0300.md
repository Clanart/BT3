# Q300: Accept wrong proof/network context in get_current_l2_block_height

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions through user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync so `get_current_l2_block_height` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the L1/L2 height pair treated as finalized and safe to bridge against and breaking the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/citrea.rs::get_current_l2_block_height
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
