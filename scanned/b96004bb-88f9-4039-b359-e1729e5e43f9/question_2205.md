# Q2205: Exploit reorg boundary handling in citrea_sequencer_commitment_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit reorg timing around Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering so `citrea_sequencer_commitment_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate` treats a non-canonical object as canonical long enough to mutate bridge state, corrupting the linkage between Citrea state and a replacement deposit move transaction and violating the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/tests.rs::citrea_sequencer_commitment_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering
- Exploit idea: reorder or replay Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering across canonical and non-canonical views
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
