# Q79: Replay context into check_kickoffs_on_chain_and_track

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with attacker-controlled the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests so `check_kickoffs_on_chain_and_track` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the operator signature set attached to a deposit to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/verifier.rs::check_kickoffs_on_chain_and_track
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
