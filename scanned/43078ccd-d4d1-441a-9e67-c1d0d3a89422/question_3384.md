# Q3384: get-cached-indexes via call-ststx-ratio: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched reach `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on, the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `get-cached-indexes` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
