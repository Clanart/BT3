# Q5688: linear-interpolate via liquidate-multi: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `linear-interpolate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
