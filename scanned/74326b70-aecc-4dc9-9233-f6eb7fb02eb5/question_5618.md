# Q5618: WombatPoolHelper.depositNative - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, is there an unprivileged sequence of `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` that leaves `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` unreconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`, violates the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value, and delivers Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence atomically under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, asserting at the end that `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` still equals `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
