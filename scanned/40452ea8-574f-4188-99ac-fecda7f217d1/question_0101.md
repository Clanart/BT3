# Q0101: output_entry_stats can be driven into unbounded work (program_metrics.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `output_entry_stats` in `program-runtime/src/program_metrics.rs` with an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation, and make `output_entry_stats` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `output_entry_stats` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/program_metrics.rs` -> `output_entry_stats()` (around line 273)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `output_entry_stats` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `output_entry_stats` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `output_entry_stats` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft bytecode, ELF metadata, precompile data, or zk proof input that panics, aborts, infinite-loops, or exhausts memory inside the VM and halts every validator.
