# Q0569: WombatPoolHelper.depositNative - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Does `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, so that `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` diverges from `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard is broken, and the result is Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, have the attacker run `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` versus `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
