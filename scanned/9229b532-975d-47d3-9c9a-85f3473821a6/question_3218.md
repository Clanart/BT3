# Q3218: filter_logs_results valid-input crash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_logs_results` by use in-scope logs subscriptions with legal filters with logs filters, encodings, and log-heavy transactions so that validly encoded account/notification state or subscription flow can still reach a panic or abort, breaking the invariant that valid inputs and valid subscription flows must not crash this path and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_logs_results
- Entrypoint: use in-scope logs subscriptions with legal filters
- Attacker controls: logs filters, encodings, and log-heavy transactions
- Exploit idea: treat state-filtering and watcher code as crash surfaces
- Invariant to test: valid inputs and valid subscription flows must not crash this path
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: fuzz only valid subscription parameters and event payload shapes while monitoring for crashes
