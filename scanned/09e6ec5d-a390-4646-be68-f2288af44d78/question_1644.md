# Q1644: WombatPoolHelperV2.withdraw - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Under the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, is there an unprivileged sequence of `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` that leaves `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` unreconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, violates the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding, and delivers High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity and _minAmount
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, snapshot `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, run the attacker's `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
