# Q2609: accounts_db.add_root roots-to-flush backlog blowup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `add_root` by submit transactions that maximize write churn near root movement with heavy write churn near root movement so that attacker-driven write patterns can keep the pending-root backlog large enough to destabilize memory or latency, breaking the invariant that pending roots and flush backlog must stay bounded under valid user workload and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::add_root
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that maximize write churn near root movement
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn near root movement
- Exploit idea: treat backlog growth as the exploit
- Invariant to test: pending roots and flush backlog must stay bounded under valid user workload
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: drive repeated write bursts across roots and monitor backlog size
