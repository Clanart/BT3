# Q2489: generate_index watcher leak on disconnect

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `generate_index` by submit transactions that create many attacker-controlled accounts with structured keys with many-account creation with common owners/layouts and repeated indexed reads so that disconnect/unsubscribe races leave watcher state or queued notifications behind, breaking the invariant that watcher teardown must reclaim all state promptly and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::generate_index
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that create many attacker-controlled accounts with structured keys
- Attacker controls: many-account creation with common owners/layouts and repeated indexed reads
- Exploit idea: stress teardown paths
- Invariant to test: watcher teardown must reclaim all state promptly
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: rapidly connect/disconnect and compare live watcher counts before and after
