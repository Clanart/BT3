# Q4899: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getReward - forfeit computed on the full userRewards on every partial settlement

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, _sendReward() prices the forfeit against the entire userRewards balance for that token each time it runs, so splitting or repeating settlements changes how much value passes through the forfeit rule. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` while a registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer, and drive `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` out of agreement with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` - breaking the invariant that total forfeit must be invariant to how a user splits their settlements - for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: forfeit computed on the full userRewards on every partial settlement)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the settlement timing, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim and through the locker's unlock path
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() prices the forfeit against the entire userRewards balance for that token each time it runs, so splitting or repeating settlements changes how much value passes through the forfeit rule. Precondition: a registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer.
- Invariant to test: total forfeit must be invariant to how a user splits their settlements; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish a registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer, have the attacker run `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` versus `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
