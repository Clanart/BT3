# Q2440: remove_unrooted_slots hot-stream starvation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove_unrooted_slots` by submit transactions across fast fork churn and then query recent state with many-account write bursts, slot churn, and recent-state queries so that one hot account/program/signature stream monopolizes work and starves other subscribers, breaking the invariant that one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::remove_unrooted_slots
- Entrypoint: submit transactions across fast fork churn and then query recent state
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts, slot churn, and recent-state queries
- Exploit idea: measure cross-subscriber fairness
- Invariant to test: one subscription stream must not starve unrelated streams
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: pair a hot stream with a cheap control subscription
