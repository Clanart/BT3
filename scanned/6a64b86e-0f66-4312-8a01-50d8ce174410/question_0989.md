# Q0989: socialize-debt-asset via liquidate-redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `socialize-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:879) — which calls the vault write-down, then overwrites `index-cache` for the current timestamp mid-fold, and carries a `success` flag that short-circuits — to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:879` -> `socialize-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `socialize-debt-asset` calls the vault write-down, then overwrites `index-cache` for the current timestamp mid-fold, and carries a `success` flag that short-circuits. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the redemption receiver, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
