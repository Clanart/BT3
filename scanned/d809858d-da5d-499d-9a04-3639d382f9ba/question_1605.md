# Q1605: Starknet ETH-signature domain missing chain or contract domain separation via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Starknet deploy/finalize entrypoints` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token and fin_transfer signature path` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `missing chain or contract domain separation` under recovers an Ethereum-style signer over raw Keccak of Borsh bytes rather than a structured Starknet domain separator, violating `signature bytes must stay uniquely bound to the intended Starknet action, chain context, and payload kind and must reject malleable variants`?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::deploy_token and fin_transfer signature path`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet deploy/finalize entrypoints`
- Attacker controls: payload bytes, chain id fields embedded in payload, and signature `v/r/s` values
- Exploit idea: Target validators keyed by derived signer, block hash, emitter address, or payload bytes that omit some domain field. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: signature bytes must stay uniquely bound to the intended Starknet action, chain context, and payload kind and must reject malleable variants
- Expected Immunefi impact: Light client verification bypass
- Fast validation: Attempt cross-chain and cross-contract replay of the same validated bytes and assert that every trust domain field participates in acceptance. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
