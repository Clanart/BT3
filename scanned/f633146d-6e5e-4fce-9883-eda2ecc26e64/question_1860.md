# Q1860: WombatPoolHelperV2.deposit - _minimumLiquidity is caller-supplied on the deposit leg

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, deposit() and depositNative() forward the caller's _minimumLiquidity into the Wombat deposit, so a caller can accept a deposit that mints far less LP than fair while the receipt mint is taken from the resulting delta. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` while the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, and drive `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` out of agreement with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` - breaking the invariant that a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded - for Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: _minimumLiquidity is caller-supplied on the deposit leg)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: deposit() and depositNative() forward the caller's _minimumLiquidity into the Wombat deposit, so a caller can accept a deposit that mints far less LP than fair while the receipt mint is taken from the resulting delta. Precondition: the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction.
- Invariant to test: a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence atomically under the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, asserting at the end that `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` still equals `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
