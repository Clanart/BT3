# Q4035: WombatPoolHelper.depositNative - _minimumLiquidity is caller-supplied on the deposit leg

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: deposit() and depositNative() forward the caller's _minimumLiquidity into the Wombat deposit, so a caller can accept a deposit that mints far less LP than fair while the receipt mint is taken from the resulting delta. With msg.value and _minimumLiquidity under attacker control and the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, can an unprivileged caller sequence `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` so that `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded and realising Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: _minimumLiquidity is caller-supplied on the deposit leg)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: deposit() and depositNative() forward the caller's _minimumLiquidity into the Wombat deposit, so a caller can accept a deposit that mints far less LP than fair while the receipt mint is taken from the resulting delta. Precondition: the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes.
- Invariant to test: a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, have the attacker run `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` versus `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
