# Q5622: filter-out-debt-asset via collateral-add: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `collateral-add` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `filter-out-debt-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
