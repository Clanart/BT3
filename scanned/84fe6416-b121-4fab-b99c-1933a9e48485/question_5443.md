# Q5443: WombatBribeManager.harvestSinglePool - harvestSinglePool drains pending bribes with no caller fee

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, where harvestSinglePool() calls wombatStaking.vote(_lps, zero deltas, rewarders, address(0)), which harvests all pending bribes while passing caller as the zero address so no caller fee is paid, letting an attacker front-run a castVotes and strip the fee that would have compensated it. Assuming the attacker passes offsetting positive and negative deltas that net to zero, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `getVoteForLp(lp) from the Wombat voter` and `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` via `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)`, breaking the invariant that a permissionless harvest must not be usable to strip the incentive from the function that maintains the gauge and producing High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)` (mechanism: harvestSinglePool drains pending bribes with no caller fee)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the lp array, forwarded straight into WombatStaking.vote with zero deltas and caller set to address(0)
- Exploit idea: harvestSinglePool() calls wombatStaking.vote(_lps, zero deltas, rewarders, address(0)), which harvests all pending bribes while passing caller as the zero address so no caller fee is paid, letting an attacker front-run a castVotes and strip the fee that would have compensated it. Precondition: the attacker passes offsetting positive and negative deltas that net to zero.
- Invariant to test: a permissionless harvest must not be usable to strip the incentive from the function that maintains the gauge; concretely, `getVoteForLp(lp) from the Wombat voter` must stay reconciled with `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the attacker passes offsetting positive and negative deltas that net to zero, call `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)`, and assert `getVoteForLp(lp) from the Wombat voter` equals `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
