# Q3618: NEAR EVM trie proof verifier length or offset shift reinterprets adjacent fields at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `internal helper reachable from public EVM proof verification` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-prover/evm-prover/src/lib.rs::verify_trie_proof/_verify_trie_proof` violate `trie traversal must reject every malformed branch/extension/leaf combination that could return attacker-chosen receipt bytes under the honest root` in the `length or offset shift reinterprets adjacent fields` attack class because walks a Patricia trie over branch, extension, and leaf nodes using nibble-expanded receipt-index keys becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-prover/evm-prover/src/lib.rs::verify_trie_proof/_verify_trie_proof`
- Entrypoint: `internal helper reachable from public EVM proof verification`
- Attacker controls: receipt index key, trie nodes, node ordering, and branch/leaf path structure
- Exploit idea: Target VAA body offsets, byte slicing helpers, RLP decoders, and Borsh length prefixes. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: trie traversal must reject every malformed branch/extension/leaf combination that could return attacker-chosen receipt bytes under the honest root
- Expected Immunefi impact: Light client verification bypass
- Fast validation: Fuzz underlong, overlong, and near-boundary payloads and assert that accepted bytes decode to exactly one structured message. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
