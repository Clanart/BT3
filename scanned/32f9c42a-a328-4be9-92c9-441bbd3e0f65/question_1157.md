# Q1157: oracle-last-update via liquidate: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, drive `oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) — which returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed — to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `liquidate` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
