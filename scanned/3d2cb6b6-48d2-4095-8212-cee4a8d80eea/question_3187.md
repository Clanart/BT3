# Q3187: filter_program_results notification context drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_program_results` by use in-scope program subscriptions with legal filters with program subscription filters, encodings, and hot account streams so that watcher or filter state can pair payloads with the wrong slot/root context, breaking the invariant that notification payloads and context must describe the same event/state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_program_results
- Entrypoint: use in-scope program subscriptions with legal filters
- Attacker controls: program subscription filters, encodings, and hot account streams
- Exploit idea: look for impossible payload/context combinations
- Invariant to test: notification payloads and context must describe the same event/state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: cross-check delivered notifications against direct state at the same reported slot/root
