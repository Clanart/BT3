# Q1204: NEAR storage_unregister storage withdrawal escapes live liabilities at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public NEAR storage-management entrypoint` with boundary-controlled inputs covering minimal deposits, maximal storage payloads, and withdrawal edges and make `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::storage_unregister` violate `unregister must never let an attacker sever the balance record that still backs unresolved bridge state or unlock more NEAR than was truly free` in the `storage withdrawal escapes live liabilities` attack class because attempts to unregister an account from bridge storage accounting becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::storage_unregister`
- Entrypoint: `public NEAR storage-management entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: force flag and timing relative to active pending/fast/finalized records
- Exploit idea: Look for withdrawals and unregister paths that do not fully account for pending, finalized, or fast-transfer records. Concentrate on minimal deposits, maximal storage payloads, and withdrawal edges.
- Invariant to test: unregister must never let an attacker sever the balance record that still backs unresolved bridge state or unlock more NEAR than was truly free
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Open live bridge state, withdraw aggressively, and assert that storage balances cannot fall below the reserved amount implied by that live state. Sweep boundary values for minimal deposits, maximal storage payloads, and withdrawal edges and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
