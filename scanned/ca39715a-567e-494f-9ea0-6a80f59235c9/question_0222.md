# Q222: Accept wrong proof/network context in mine_and_get_first_n_block_headers

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering through broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation so `mine_and_get_first_n_block_headers` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/header_chain_prover.rs::mine_and_get_first_n_block_headers
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
