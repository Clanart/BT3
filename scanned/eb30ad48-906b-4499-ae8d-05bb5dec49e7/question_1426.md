# Q1426: deposit batch cancel partial state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `deposit` by submit transactions invoking writable-account instructions with lamport amounts, account ownership transitions, cpi ordering, and close/reopen patterns such that batch cancellation or conflict resolution can leave some side effects committed while the batch is treated as failed or retried, breaking the invariant that all-or-nothing expectations for a batch outcome must match committed state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::deposit
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking writable-account instructions
- Attacker controls: lamport amounts, account ownership transitions, CPI ordering, and close/reopen patterns
- Exploit idea: use conflicting batched transactions to look for half-committed outcomes
- Invariant to test: all-or-nothing expectations for a batch outcome must match committed state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: submit deliberately conflicting batches and diff committed accounts against reported batch results
