# Q4282: MasterMagpie.massUpdatePools - lpSupply inflation by direct token donation

## Question
In rewards/MasterMagpie.sol, _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `massUpdatePools()` while the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol whose getRewards body is empty, and drive `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].available` out of agreement with `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].amount` - breaking the invariant that MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply - for High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `massUpdatePools()` (mechanism: lpSupply inflation by direct token donation)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `massUpdatePools()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the block in which every registered pool is rolled forward at once
- Exploit idea: _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Precondition: the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol whose getRewards body is empty.
- Invariant to test: MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply; concretely, `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].available` must stay reconciled with `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].amount`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol whose getRewards body is empty, call `massUpdatePools()`, and assert `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].available` equals `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].amount` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
