# Q5329: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction and force `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` apart from `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`, breaking the invariant that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent for High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Precondition: the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction.
- Invariant to test: an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`: constrain the setup so that the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, fuzz the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool), and assert after every call that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent.
