# Q3625: mWOM.convertAndStake - rewardRatio is explicitly allowed to exceed one hundred percent

## Question
In wombat/mWOM.sol, the contract comment states the ratio can be more than 100%, and setRewardRatio applies no DENOMINATOR ceiling, so the vlMGP paid can exceed the value of the WOM deposited and the incentive pot drains faster than it is funded. Starting from a state where helper is set to a SimplePoolHelper and the attacker uses convertAndStake, can an unprivileged EOA use `convertAndStake(uint256 _amount)` to leave `vlMGPAmount = _amount * rewardRatio / DENOMINATOR` inconsistent with `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(address(this))`, violating the invariant that the value paid out per unit deposited must be bounded so the incentive cannot exceed its funding and extracting Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWOM.sol -> `convertAndStake(uint256 _amount)` (mechanism: rewardRatio is explicitly allowed to exceed one hundred percent)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `convertAndStake(uint256 _amount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and the helper routing that stakes the freshly minted mWOM
- Exploit idea: the contract comment states the ratio can be more than 100%, and setRewardRatio applies no DENOMINATOR ceiling, so the vlMGP paid can exceed the value of the WOM deposited and the incentive pot drains faster than it is funded. Precondition: helper is set to a SimplePoolHelper and the attacker uses convertAndStake.
- Invariant to test: the value paid out per unit deposited must be bounded so the incentive cannot exceed its funding; concretely, `vlMGPAmount = _amount * rewardRatio / DENOMINATOR` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount and the helper routing that stakes the freshly minted mWOM) under helper is set to a SimplePoolHelper and the attacker uses convertAndStake, asserting on every row that the value paid out per unit deposited must be bounded so the incentive cannot exceed its funding.
