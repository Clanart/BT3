# Q3005: notify_roots many-pubkey memory balloon

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_roots` by subscribe to roots and then drive hot slot/root movement with root subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot root movement so that one user can create enough cache/index state through attacker-owned accounts to exhaust memory faster than cleanup responds, breaking the invariant that attacker-owned account fanout must not create unbounded cache or index growth and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_roots
- Entrypoint: subscribe to roots and then drive hot slot/root movement
- Attacker controls: root subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot root movement
- Exploit idea: use many small valid accounts as the amplifier
- Invariant to test: attacker-owned account fanout must not create unbounded cache or index growth
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: create many valid attacker-controlled accounts and track cache/index growth
