# Q1398: Race process_with_ctx across concurrent state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch, retry, or reorder public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline interactions around the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering so `process_with_ctx` observes inconsistent state across memory, database, and on-chain checks, breaking the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, and leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/states/mod.rs::process_with_ctx
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering
- Exploit idea: use retries, batching, or timing around the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering to desynchronize state
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
