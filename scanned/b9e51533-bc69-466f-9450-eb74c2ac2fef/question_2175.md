# Q2175: Exploit reorg boundary handling in fetch_validate_and_store_lcp

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit reorg timing around replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions so `fetch_validate_and_store_lcp` treats a non-canonical object as canonical long enough to mutate bridge state, corrupting the light-client proof context tied to a specific Bitcoin block and violating the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/citrea.rs::fetch_validate_and_store_lcp
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions
- Exploit idea: reorder or replay replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions across canonical and non-canonical views
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
