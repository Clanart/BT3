# Q2281: Confuse replacement linkage in insert_operator_kickoff_winternitz_public_keys_if_not_exist

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit` so `insert_operator_kickoff_winternitz_public_keys_if_not_exist` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the operator signature set attached to a deposit to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/operator.rs::insert_operator_kickoff_winternitz_public_keys_if_not_exist
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
