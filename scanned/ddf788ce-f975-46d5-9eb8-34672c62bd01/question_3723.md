# Q3723: redirect_to_app: A `return_to` relative path joined to attacker `decoded_host` p...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`host` (base64) and `return_to` (session, originally attacker-seeded via login)) reach `redirect_to_app / decoded_host / deduced_phishing_attack? / fully_formed_url?` in app/controllers/shopify_app/callback_controller.rb via GET /auth/shopify/callback completion redirect, supplying a `return_to` relative path joined to attacker `decoded_host` producing an external absolute URL, so that the post-auth redirect must land on the app inside the acting shop's admin, never an attacker origin is violated, leading to open redirect delivering the freshly minted session/host to an attacker (token exfiltration)? Specifically confirm that the crafted request is rejected or scoped to the attacker's own shop.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/callback_controller.rb — `redirect_to_app / decoded_host / deduced_phishing_attack? / fully_formed_url?`
- Entrypoint: GET /auth/shopify/callback completion redirect
- Attacker controls: `host` (base64) and `return_to` (session, originally attacker-seeded via login) — specifically a `return_to` relative path joined to attacker `decoded_host` producing an external absolute URL.
- Exploit idea: Craft the single HTTP request above against a default app install and confirm the boundary holds.
- Invariant to test: the post-auth redirect must land on the app inside the acting shop's admin, never an attacker origin
- Expected Immunefi impact: open redirect delivering the freshly minted session/host to an attacker (token exfiltration) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: controller/request spec issuing the crafted request and asserting a 401/redirect-to-own-origin, not access.
