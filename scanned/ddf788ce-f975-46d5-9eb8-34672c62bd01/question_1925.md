# Q1925: hmac_valid?: A base64 HMAC with different padding/whitespace than `strict_en...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the raw request body, the X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header) reach `hmac_valid? / shopify_hmac` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/payload_verification.rb via POST /webhooks/:type (WebhooksController) and the extension verification controller, supplying a base64 HMAC with different padding/whitespace than `strict_encode64` output to probe the comparison, so that only a body HMAC'd with the app's real secret may be accepted, over the exact signed bytes is violated, leading to forged webhook accepted -> unauthorized state change / spoofed shop data? Specifically confirm that no encoding variant of the input is accepted as a different-but-trusted value.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/payload_verification.rb — `hmac_valid? / shopify_hmac`
- Entrypoint: POST /webhooks/:type (WebhooksController) and the extension verification controller
- Attacker controls: the raw request body, the X-Shopify-Hmac-SHA256 header — specifically a base64 HMAC with different padding/whitespace than `strict_encode64` output to probe the comparison.
- Exploit idea: Fuzz the encoding/normalization boundary (case, unicode, punycode, base64 leniency, delimiters).
- Invariant to test: only a body HMAC'd with the app's real secret may be accepted, over the exact signed bytes
- Expected Immunefi impact: forged webhook accepted -> unauthorized state change / spoofed shop data (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: property/fuzz test over encodings asserting sanitize/verify rejects every non-canonical form.
