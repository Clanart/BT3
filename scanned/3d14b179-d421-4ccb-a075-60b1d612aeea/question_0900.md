# Q900: simulate_transaction fee-payer unlock split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `simulate_transaction` by json-rpc `simulatetransaction` with serialized transaction bytes, account-request config, sigverify / replacerecentblockhash flags, and cpi-heavy programs such that fee-payer lock or unlock handling may diverge from the accounts actually charged later, breaking the invariant that fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::simulate_transaction
- Entrypoint: JSON-RPC `simulateTransaction`
- Attacker controls: serialized transaction bytes, account-request config, sigVerify / replaceRecentBlockhash flags, and CPI-heavy programs
- Exploit idea: try to free or relock the fee payer at the wrong moment
- Invariant to test: fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace fee-payer lock state across retries, conflicts, and partial failures
