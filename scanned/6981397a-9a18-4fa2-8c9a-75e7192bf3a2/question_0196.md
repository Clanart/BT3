# Q196: State-Machine Swap With Duplicate Or Reordered Items

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `HandlerV2.handleConsensus(IHost host, bytes proof)` with attacker-controlled consensus proof bytes, authority indices, header batches, state-machine identifiers, and claimed heights and placing duplicate or reordered leaves, signatures, requests, responses, timeouts, or commitments inside one user-accessible batch, and make `verify` verify one parachain or state machine while storing commitments for another so `the stateMachineId-to-height commitment mapping` becomes inconsistent with `the chain id and height that were actually proven`, breaking the invariant that a verified proof must never populate commitments for a different state machine, parachain id, or height than the one authenticated and leading to Critical: false state acceptance that can unlock unauthorized cross-chain execution, withdrawals, or settlement?

## Target
- File/function: evm/src/consensus/ConsensusRouter.sol::verify
- Entrypoint: HandlerV2.handleConsensus(IHost host, bytes proof)
- Attacker controls: consensus proof bytes, authority indices, header batches, state-machine identifiers, and claimed heights
- Exploit idea: Verify one parachain or state machine while storing commitments for another. Use a batch with one honest item and one duplicated or reordered item to see whether unique-item assumptions collapse.
- Invariant to test: a verified proof must never populate commitments for a different state machine, parachain id, or height than the one authenticated
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: false state acceptance that can unlock unauthorized cross-chain execution, withdrawals, or settlement.
- Fast validation: Build a proof where one header or leaf is swapped to another chain id and assert no commitment is stored under the attacker-chosen key. Write a focused batch test with repeated indices or commitments and assert only unique authenticated items can affect state.
