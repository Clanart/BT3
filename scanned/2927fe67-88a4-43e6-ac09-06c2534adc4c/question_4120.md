# Q4120: remove-user-collateral via transfer: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `transfer` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `transfer` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
