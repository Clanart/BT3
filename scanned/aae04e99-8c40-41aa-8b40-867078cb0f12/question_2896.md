# Q2896: current_shopify_session: A mismatched `session` param vs `current_shopify_session.shopif...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` URL param, the Authorization: Bearer header, `shop`, `host`, `session`, and the encrypted session cookie value) reach `current_shopify_session / load_current_session` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb via GET any EnsureHasSession-protected controller action (legacy auth strategy), supplying a mismatched `session` param vs `current_shopify_session.shopify_session_id` to probe `session_id_conflicts_with_params`, so that id_token verification errors must fail closed, never yield an activated session is violated, leading to authentication bypass? Specifically confirm that the security property holds for the whole generated input class, not just one example.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb — `current_shopify_session / load_current_session`
- Entrypoint: GET any EnsureHasSession-protected controller action (legacy auth strategy)
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` URL param, the Authorization: Bearer header, `shop`, `host`, `session`, and the encrypted session cookie value — specifically a mismatched `session` param vs `current_shopify_session.shopify_session_id` to probe `session_id_conflicts_with_params`.
- Exploit idea: State the security property as an invariant and check it over a generated range of related inputs.
- Invariant to test: id_token verification errors must fail closed, never yield an activated session
- Expected Immunefi impact: authentication bypass (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: invariant/property test over generated inputs asserting the security property holds universally.
