# Q894: NEAR OmniToken burn native versus wrapped branch switch via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public bridge-token burn path via controller-only callback reached from outbound bridge flows` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `near/omni-token/src/lib.rs::burn` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `native versus wrapped branch switch` under controller-only burn always withdraws from `env::predecessor_account_id()` rather than an explicit account parameter, violating `outbound burning must always debit the exact bridged balance that backs the emitted bridge event and must not depend on an attacker-rebindable predecessor context`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-token/src/lib.rs::burn`
- Entrypoint: `public bridge-token burn path via controller-only callback reached from outbound bridge flows`
- Attacker controls: amount and predecessor account used as the balance source
- Exploit idea: Target zero-address, deployed-token, custom-minter, native-vault, or bridge-token branch predicates. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: outbound burning must always debit the exact bridged balance that backs the emitted bridge event and must not depend on an attacker-rebindable predecessor context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each branch predicate to flip around callbacks or mapping writes and assert that the same source asset can never produce two incompatible custody models. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
