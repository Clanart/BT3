# Q1869: NEAR Wormhole LogMetadata conversion emitter or factory binding mismatch at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Wormhole metadata proof flow` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/parsed_vaa.rs::TryInto<LogMetadataMessage>` violate `metadata proofs must not be malleable across chain/address boundaries or string encodings that deploy the wrong wrapped token` in the `emitter or factory binding mismatch` attack class because Borsh-decodes a Wormhole payload into `LogMetadataMessage` and derives the emitter address from the token-address chain and VAA emitter bytes becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/parsed_vaa.rs::TryInto<LogMetadataMessage>`
- Entrypoint: `public Wormhole metadata proof flow`
- Attacker controls: payload bytes inside a validated VAA, token address chain, name, symbol, and decimals
- Exploit idea: Target derivation of emitter identity from token-address chain, VAA bytes, or factory maps. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: metadata proofs must not be malleable across chain/address boundaries or string encodings that deploy the wrong wrapped token
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Forge mismatched token-chain and emitter-chain combinations and assert that source authentication fails unless every binding agrees. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
