# Q5704: WombatPoolHelper.depositLP - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol - the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller, under MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, exploit this through `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` to break the reconciliation between `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` and the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value, yielding Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, snapshot `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`, run the attacker's `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
