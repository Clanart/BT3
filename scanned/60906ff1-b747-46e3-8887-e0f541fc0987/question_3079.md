# Q3079: Accept-And-Timeout Double Settlement After Partial State Change

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `pallet_hyper_fungible_token::send(origin, params)` with attacker-controlled send parameters, remote token mappings, precision values, authenticated inbound messages, and timeout inputs and replaying the same public flow after one part of storage changed and another part did not, and make `send` settle both receive and refund for the same substrate-side token transfer lifecycle so `the one-time lifecycle state for one token transfer` becomes inconsistent with `one final outcome of receive or refund`, breaking the invariant that a substrate-side token transfer must end in one of receive or refund, never both and leading to Critical: wrongful mint, unlock, withdrawal, refund, or redirect of protocol-controlled or user escrowed assets?

## Target
- File/function: modules/pallets/hyper-fungible-token/src/lib.rs::send
- Entrypoint: pallet_hyper_fungible_token::send(origin, params)
- Attacker controls: send parameters, remote token mappings, precision values, authenticated inbound messages, and timeout inputs
- Exploit idea: Settle both receive and refund for the same substrate-side token transfer lifecycle. Drive a partial success or revert path first, then replay the same user-controlled input and check whether stale state is reused.
- Invariant to test: a substrate-side token transfer must end in one of receive or refund, never both
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: wrongful mint, unlock, withdrawal, refund, or redirect of protocol-controlled or user escrowed assets.
- Fast validation: Drive a receive path and a timeout path for the same commitment and assert balances and supply reflect one terminal outcome. Exercise a success-then-replay or fail-then-replay sequence and assert claimed flags, receipts, escrow, and nonces stay coherent.
