# Q0545: sanitize_shop_domain: A shop value that raises `Addressable::URI::InvalidURIError` so...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the raw `shop` string and its casing, scheme, path, port, userinfo and unicode form) reach `sanitize_shop_domain / uri_from_shop_domain` in lib/shopify_app/utils.rb via any route taking a ?shop= param (GET /login, GET /auth/shopify/callback, embedded pages), supplying a shop value that raises `Addressable::URI::InvalidURIError` so `sanitize_shop_domain` returns nil and a caller treats nil-shop as a wildcard, so that a non-Shopify host must never pass sanitize_shop_domain and be treated as trusted is violated, leading to open redirect / OAuth-token leak to an attacker-controlled origin? Specifically confirm that merchant A can never load, write, or act with merchant B's session, token, or scopes.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/utils.rb — `sanitize_shop_domain / uri_from_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: any route taking a ?shop= param (GET /login, GET /auth/shopify/callback, embedded pages)
- Attacker controls: the raw `shop` string and its casing, scheme, path, port, userinfo and unicode form — specifically a shop value that raises `Addressable::URI::InvalidURIError` so `sanitize_shop_domain` returns nil and a caller treats nil-shop as a wildcard.
- Exploit idea: Perform the flow as merchant A while naming shop/user B and confirm no B-scoped data is reachable.
- Invariant to test: a non-Shopify host must never pass sanitize_shop_domain and be treated as trusted
- Expected Immunefi impact: open redirect / OAuth-token leak to an attacker-controlled origin (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: two-tenant integration test asserting A's request never loads, writes, or acts with B's session/token.
