# Q3356: Break reimbursement recoverability in deposit_sign

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with crafted the `deposit_outpoint` and its on-chain prevout details so `deposit_sign` moves the protocol past the point where reimbursement should remain recoverable, leaving the nofn aggregate key and covenant context inconsistent with the assumption that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, and leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/operator.rs::deposit_sign
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `deposit_outpoint` and its on-chain prevout details
- Exploit idea: move bridge state forward while reimbursement/slashability stays tied to older state
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
