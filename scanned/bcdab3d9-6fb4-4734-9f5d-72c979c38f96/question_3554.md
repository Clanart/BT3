# Q3554: MsgEthereumTx.BuildTx - Gas Limit In Authinfo Differs From Raw Tx Gas After Defaulting

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a Cosmos-wrapped Ethereum transaction through `RPC-built Cosmos transaction containing MsgEthereumTx` while controlling `raw tx payload` and `From bytes`, under the precondition that the same Cosmos tx contains more than one MsgEthereumTx, drive `NewAnteHandler route selection -> Ethereum ante decorators -> MsgEthereumTx execution` in `x/evm/types/msg.go::MsgEthereumTx.BuildTx` so that gas limit in AuthInfo differs from raw tx gas after defaulting, violating the invariant that fee/gas AuthInfo must equal the embedded Ethereum tx data, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/types/msg.go::MsgEthereumTx.BuildTx`
- Entrypoint: `RPC-built Cosmos transaction containing MsgEthereumTx`
- Attacker controls: `raw tx payload`, `From bytes`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: gas limit in AuthInfo differs from raw tx gas after defaulting through `NewAnteHandler route selection -> Ethereum ante decorators -> MsgEthereumTx execution`.
- Invariant to test: fee/gas AuthInfo must equal the embedded Ethereum tx data.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: compare IndexBlock/GetTransactionReceipt/GetBlockReceipts output against direct block/result reconstruction for the same transaction.
