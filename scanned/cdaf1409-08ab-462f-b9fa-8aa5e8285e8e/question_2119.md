# Q2119: Substitute a wrong proof path into storage_verify

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker substitute part of attacker-controlled Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents so `storage_verify` accepts a proof, header, or path that should have been rejected, corrupting the canonical header-chain state and total work and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/storage_proof.rs::storage_verify
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Exploit idea: swap part of attacker-controlled Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents while keeping the rest seemingly valid
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
