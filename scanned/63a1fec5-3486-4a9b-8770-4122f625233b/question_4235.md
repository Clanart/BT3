# Q4235: next-liquidity-index via liquidate: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `min-collateral-expected`, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `liquidate` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-collateral-expected`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
