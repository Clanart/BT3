# Q1796: translate_instruction_c writeback ordering

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `translate_instruction_c` by submit transactions that perform cpi with nested instruction payloads, duplicated accounts, signer seeds, and edge-case account lists such that writes can land in a different order than the logic assumed when computing fees, locks, or state deltas, breaking the invariant that writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/cpi.rs::translate_instruction_c
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that perform CPI
- Attacker controls: nested instruction payloads, duplicated accounts, signer seeds, and edge-case account lists
- Exploit idea: search for ordering dependencies that break under batching or CPI
- Invariant to test: writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace write order and derived counters under multi-instruction, multi-CPI transactions
