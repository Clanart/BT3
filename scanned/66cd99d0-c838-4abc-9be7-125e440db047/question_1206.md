# Q1206: safe_embedded_app_url: A base64 `host` decoding to `admin.shopify.com/store/x@attacker...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the base64 `host` param, or the `shop` param used to synthesize host) reach `safe_embedded_app_url / deduced_phishing_attack? / unsafe_embedded_host?` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/embedded_app.rb via GET a page that redirects to the embedded admin (invalid-token path, ensure_installed), supplying a base64 `host` decoding to `admin.shopify.com/store/x@attacker.com` combining userinfo and unified-admin paths, so that the decoded embedded host must resolve to a Shopify admin origin for the acting shop only is violated, leading to open redirect to attacker origin carrying id_token/host (token exfiltration)? Specifically confirm that a wrong-secret or tampered artifact is always rejected before any side effect.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/embedded_app.rb — `safe_embedded_app_url / deduced_phishing_attack? / unsafe_embedded_host?`
- Entrypoint: GET a page that redirects to the embedded admin (invalid-token path, ensure_installed)
- Attacker controls: the base64 `host` param, or the `shop` param used to synthesize host — specifically a base64 `host` decoding to `admin.shopify.com/store/x@attacker.com` combining userinfo and unified-admin paths.
- Exploit idea: Run the exact flow with a deliberately-wrong secret/signature/token to prove verification actually rejects it.
- Invariant to test: the decoded embedded host must resolve to a Shopify admin origin for the acting shop only
- Expected Immunefi impact: open redirect to attacker origin carrying id_token/host (token exfiltration) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: negative-control test asserting a wrong-secret/wrong-signature/tampered-token request is rejected with no side effect.
