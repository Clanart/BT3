# Q1620: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.withdraw - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
Consider wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, where the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Assuming the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` and `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` via `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`, breaking the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value and producing Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the pool's deposit token charges a transfer fee so the Wombat deposit receives less than requested, call `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`, and assert `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` equals `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
