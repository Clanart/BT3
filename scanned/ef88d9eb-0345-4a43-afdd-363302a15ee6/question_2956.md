# Q2956: BaseRewardPoolV2.updateFor - donation front-run of a legitimate queueNewRewards

## Question
In rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol, an attacker inflates totalStaked() (which reads IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(operator)) in the block before the reward manager calls queueNewRewards, so the manager's distribution is divided by an inflated denominator and truncates. Does `updateFor(address _account)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under a reward-manager queueNewRewards transaction is pending in the mempool, so that `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` diverges from `userRewardPerTokenPaid[_rewardToken][account]`, the invariant that the reward-per-token increment for a queued distribution must not be reducible by a third party in the same block is broken, and the result is High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol -> `updateFor(address _account)` (mechanism: donation front-run of a legitimate queueNewRewards)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `updateFor(address _account)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted
- Exploit idea: an attacker inflates totalStaked() (which reads IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(operator)) in the block before the reward manager calls queueNewRewards, so the manager's distribution is divided by an inflated denominator and truncates. Precondition: a reward-manager queueNewRewards transaction is pending in the mempool.
- Invariant to test: the reward-per-token increment for a queued distribution must not be reducible by a third party in the same block; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` must stay reconciled with `userRewardPerTokenPaid[_rewardToken][account]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `updateFor(address _account)`: constrain the setup so that a reward-manager queueNewRewards transaction is pending in the mempool, fuzz the attacker inputs (the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted), and assert after every call that the reward-per-token increment for a queued distribution must not be reducible by a third party in the same block.
