# Q1733: translate_instruction_rust sysvar snapshot drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `translate_instruction_rust` by submit transactions that perform cpi with nested instruction payloads, duplicated accounts, signer seeds, and edge-case account lists such that clock, rent, blockhash, or slot-hash values observed here can drift relative to the state later committed, breaking the invariant that a transaction should observe one coherent sysvar snapshot for its admitted execution context and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/cpi.rs::translate_instruction_rust
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that perform CPI
- Attacker controls: nested instruction payloads, duplicated accounts, signer seeds, and edge-case account lists
- Exploit idea: search for split sysvar snapshots across one processing lifecycle
- Invariant to test: a transaction should observe one coherent sysvar snapshot for its admitted execution context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace sysvar values at admission, execution, and commit
