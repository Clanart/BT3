# Q1502: NEAR sign_transfer callback resume-path replay or duplication via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `MPC-signature callback reachable from public `sign_transfer`` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::sign_transfer_callback` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `resume-path replay or duplication` under conditionally removes the stored transfer when fee is zero and emits the signed event after MPC returns a signature, violating `signature callbacks must not let stored transfers disappear, survive, or be re-signed in a way that breaks one-deposit-one-signed-message semantics`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::sign_transfer_callback`
- Entrypoint: `MPC-signature callback reachable from public `sign_transfer``
- Attacker controls: callback timing, whether fee is zero, stored transfer contents, and replay of the same public sign flow
- Exploit idea: Abuse yield/resume or asynchronous callback timing so the same pending outbound transfer is restarted after it already progressed. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: signature callbacks must not let stored transfers disappear, survive, or be re-signed in a way that breaks one-deposit-one-signed-message semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trigger timeouts, duplicate funding, and repeated callback delivery and assert that the resumed transfer either progresses once or cleanly fails once. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
