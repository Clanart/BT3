# Q2893: Keeper.Simulate - Simulated Set Code Authorization Consumes Nonce Differently Than Real Tx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker send public JSON-RPC or gRPC call, estimate, simulate, or trace requests through `public eth_simulateV1-style simulation request` while controlling `baseFee` and `from/to/value`, under the precondition that the simulated call is later submitted as a real transaction, drive `JSON-RPC args -> TransactionArgs.ToMessage -> ApplyMessageWithConfig(commit=false) -> compare committed tx path` in `x/evm/keeper/simulate.go::Keeper.Simulate` so that simulated set-code authorization consumes nonce differently than real tx, violating the invariant that state overrides must be read-only, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/simulate.go::Keeper.Simulate`
- Entrypoint: `public eth_simulateV1-style simulation request`
- Attacker controls: `baseFee`, `from/to/value`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: simulated set-code authorization consumes nonce differently than real tx through `JSON-RPC args -> TransactionArgs.ToMessage -> ApplyMessageWithConfig(commit=false) -> compare committed tx path`.
- Invariant to test: state overrides must be read-only.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: force the edge value at uint64/uint256/sdk.Int boundaries and assert no smaller debit, larger refund, or supply change occurs.
