# Q2835: Decouple emergency protection in aggregator_deposit_finalize_verifier_timeout

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker push attacker-controlled the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests through public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `aggregator_deposit_finalize_verifier_timeout` advances the main settlement path while the emergency-stop or recovery path remains tied to a different context, corrupting the verifier nonce session that a final signature is supposed to consume and breaking the invariant that partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/rpc/aggregator.rs::aggregator_deposit_finalize_verifier_timeout
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests
- Exploit idea: advance the main path while protection/recovery remains tied to another context
- Invariant to test: partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
