# Q3711: Solana finalize response serialization optional string alias changes bridge subject at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public finalize instructions through `FinalizeTransfer::process`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/finalize_transfer.rs` violate `response serialization must not let Near interpret a finalized Solana event under a different transfer id, amount, or fee recipient than Solana actually executed` in the `optional string alias changes bridge subject` attack class because serializes a finalize response that Near later uses for fee claims and replay coupling becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/finalize_transfer.rs`
- Entrypoint: `public finalize instructions through `FinalizeTransfer::process``
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, token mint, amount, fee recipient, and transfer id returned toward Near
- Exploit idea: Focus on optional fee recipients, empty messages, token strings, and recipient strings. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: response serialization must not let Near interpret a finalized Solana event under a different transfer id, amount, or fee recipient than Solana actually executed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Cross-parse edge-case strings across all implementations and assert a single canonical meaning for every accepted value. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
