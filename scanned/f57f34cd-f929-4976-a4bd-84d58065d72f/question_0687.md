# Q0687: to_versioned_transaction can be driven into unbounded work (sdk_transactions.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `to_versioned_transaction` in `runtime-transaction/src/runtime_transaction/sdk_transactions.rs` with a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit, and make `to_versioned_transaction` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `to_versioned_transaction` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime-transaction/src/runtime_transaction/sdk_transactions.rs` -> `to_versioned_transaction()` (around line 144)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `to_versioned_transaction` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `to_versioned_transaction` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `to_versioned_transaction` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft bytecode, ELF metadata, precompile data, or zk proof input that panics, aborts, infinite-loops, or exhausts memory inside the VM and halts every validator.
