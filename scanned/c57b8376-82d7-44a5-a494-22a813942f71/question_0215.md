# Q0215: receive-underlying via transfer: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) pulls the underlying from a named account. Can an unprivileged caller of `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), by choosing `amount`, use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `transfer` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `transfer` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
