# Q5570: price-multi-resolve via liquidate-redeem: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, can an unprivileged attacker make `price-multi-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397) make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? `price-multi-resolve` folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397` -> `price-multi-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `price-multi-resolve` folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the vault whose share price the redemption moves varied, and assert that the value `price-multi-resolve` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
