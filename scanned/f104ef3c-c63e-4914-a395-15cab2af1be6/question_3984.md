# Q3984: NEAR deploy_token entry fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public `deploy_token` proof-submission flow` with control over proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and timing relative to other token deployments and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token` from the adjacent token-mapping and asset-identity logic that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical` attack class because verifies a metadata proof and forwards the attached deposit into `deploy_token_callback` to deploy a wrapped or native bridge token on Near, violating `one remote asset and one metadata event must map to one canonical token deployment with coherent decimals and storage accounting`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token`
- Entrypoint: `public `deploy_token` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and timing relative to other token deployments
- Exploit idea: Target checks that only inspect mint authority, owner, or one mapping row without proving the full asset identity. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent token-mapping and asset-identity logic.
- Invariant to test: one remote asset and one metadata event must map to one canonical token deployment with coherent decimals and storage accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Construct plausible fake bridge-controlled assets and assert that deployment, settlement, and forwarding reject them unless they are the canonical mapping for that remote asset. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token` and the adjacent token-mapping and asset-identity logic after every branch.
