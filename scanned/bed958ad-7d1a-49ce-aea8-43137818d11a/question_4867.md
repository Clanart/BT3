# Q4867: insert via collateral-add: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
`insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), use that to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), then read `insert` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
