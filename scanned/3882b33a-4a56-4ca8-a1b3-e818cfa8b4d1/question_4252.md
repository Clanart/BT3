# Q4252: WombatPoolHelper.harvest - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, where none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Assuming the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `this.balance(msg.sender)` and `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` via `harvest()`, breaking the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard and producing Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the exact block at which the pool's rewards are harvested and fee-split
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `harvest()` sequence atomically under the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, asserting at the end that `this.balance(msg.sender)` still equals `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
