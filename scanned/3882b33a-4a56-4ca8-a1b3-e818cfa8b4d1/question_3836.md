# Q3836: WombatPoolHelperV2.depositLP - stray receipt tokens on the helper are swept into the next deposit

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, the balance-delta measurement in _deposit() and depositLP() assumes the helper holds no unattributed stakingToken, so any receipt token left there by a partial mint, a rounding residue or a direct transfer is credited to the next depositor. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` under the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes and force `this.balance(msg.sender)` apart from `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`, breaking the invariant that a helper must never credit a depositor with receipt tokens it did not mint for that deposit for Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: stray receipt tokens on the helper are swept into the next deposit)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount
- Exploit idea: the balance-delta measurement in _deposit() and depositLP() assumes the helper holds no unattributed stakingToken, so any receipt token left there by a partial mint, a rounding residue or a direct transfer is credited to the next depositor. Precondition: the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes.
- Invariant to test: a helper must never credit a depositor with receipt tokens it did not mint for that deposit; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, have the attacker run `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `this.balance(msg.sender)` versus `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
