# Q4494: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getRewards - queueMGP(uint256,address,address) is the MGP entry point used by MasterMagpie._sendMGPForVlMGPPool

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, this additional entry point widens who can move the pool's accounting state, so the set of actors able to choose when the reward index changes is larger than the manager role the design assumes. Starting from a state where the victim has not settled for several epochs and holds a large userRewards balance, can an unprivileged EOA use `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` to leave `forfeitAmount` inconsistent with `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored`, violating the invariant that only an authorised manager may decide when and by how much the reward index moves and extracting High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: queueMGP(uint256,address,address) is the MGP entry point used by MasterMagpie._sendMGPForVlMGPPool)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: this additional entry point widens who can move the pool's accounting state, so the set of actors able to choose when the reward index changes is larger than the manager role the design assumes. Precondition: the victim has not settled for several epochs and holds a large userRewards balance.
- Invariant to test: only an authorised manager may decide when and by how much the reward index moves; concretely, `forfeitAmount` must stay reconciled with `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor) under the victim has not settled for several epochs and holds a large userRewards balance, asserting on every row that only an authorised manager may decide when and by how much the reward index moves.
