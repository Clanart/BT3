# Q3080: validate conditions derive a different canonical hash via AGG SIG ME and AGG SIG UNSAFE condition mixes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker include a spend in a block generator targeting `validate_conditions` in `crates/chia-consensus/src/conditions.rs` with AGG_SIG_ME and AGG_SIG_UNSAFE condition mixes at a fork-height or boundary-value activation point make chia_rs derive a different canonical hash, violating the invariant that only spend conditions satisfying consensus rules are accepted, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-consensus/src/conditions.rs:1601` / `validate_conditions`
- Entrypoint: include a spend in a block generator
- Attacker controls: AGG_SIG_ME and AGG_SIG_UNSAFE condition mixes
- Exploit idea: Drive `validate_conditions` through its public caller path using AGG_SIG_ME and AGG_SIG_UNSAFE condition mixes; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: only spend conditions satisfying consensus rules are accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption
- Fast validation: differential-test mempool flags versus block flags for the same spend.
