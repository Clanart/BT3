# Q3251: to bytes produce a Rust/Python disagreement via public key and signature byte encodings

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker derive keys from attacker-controlled indexes targeting `to_bytes` in `crates/chia-bls/src/gtelement.rs` with public key and signature byte encodings when a node processes data from an untrusted peer or wallet make chia_rs produce a Rust/Python disagreement, violating the invariant that invalid, infinity, or subgroup-edge keys cannot authorize spends, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Consensus-valid spend, block generator, proof, or block record path can mint, burn, steal, double-spend, or mis-account Chia coins/rewards/fees?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-bls/src/gtelement.rs:37` / `to_bytes`
- Entrypoint: derive keys from attacker-controlled indexes
- Attacker controls: public key and signature byte encodings
- Exploit idea: Drive `to_bytes` through its public caller path using public key and signature byte encodings; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: invalid, infinity, or subgroup-edge keys cannot authorize spends
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Consensus-valid spend, block generator, proof, or block record path can mint, burn, steal, double-spend, or mis-account Chia coins/rewards/fees
- Fast validation: construct aggregate signature vectors with duplicates, infinity, and swapped messages.
