# Q68: execute_l1_handler_transaction meta-transaction auth bypass in execution/transaction_impls.cairo (nested-call revert edge)

## Question
Can a malicious L1-to-L2 message sender controlling the message payload and timing use transaction calldata, nonce selection, resource bounds and tip, signature material accepted by the sender's own account contract, message payloads, message ordering to make `execute_l1_handler_transaction` in `crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/transaction_impls.cairo` use the meta-transaction or version-0 compatibility path to bypass an authorization, nonce, or fee assumption that holds in the normal invoke path around account nonce and replay protection, so that honest StarkNet OS execution commits, emits, or accepts an attacker-favorable result that reaches direct loss of funds? Can the discrepancy be triggered only after a nested call, constructor call, or inner revert changes ownership of side effects?

## Target
- File/function: crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/transaction_impls.cairo:374 :: execute_l1_handler_transaction
- Entrypoint: malicious L1-to-L2 message sender controlling the message payload and timing
- Attacker controls: transaction calldata, nonce selection, resource bounds and tip, signature material accepted by the sender's own account contract, message payloads, message ordering
- Exploit idea: rebind signature, caller, or version semantics so an inner call executes with weaker checks than the outer transaction context implies while this function is handling account nonce and replay protection. Drive the bug only after nested execution crosses a caller/callee or revert boundary.
- Invariant to test: meta-transaction compatibility must not weaken nonce, caller, signature, or fee invariants compared with the normal user-facing invoke path Nested execution and rollback must preserve the same ownership and rollback invariant as the flat path.
- Expected bounty impact: Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: exercise version-0, meta-tx, and nested-call combinations around this function, then assert no accepted trace can do something that the equivalent normal invoke path would reject Construct a nested-call test with mixed success/failure outcomes and assert state, messages, and class changes stay attributable and revertable.
