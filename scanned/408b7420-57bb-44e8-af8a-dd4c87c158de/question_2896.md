# Q2896: Purchase-Message Misbinding With Duplicate Or Reordered Items

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `BandwidthManager.purchase(...) -> pallet_ismp::handle_unsigned(origin=None, messages)` with attacker-controlled authenticated purchase messages, app and chain identifiers, tier configuration values, and replay ordering and placing duplicate or reordered leaves, signatures, requests, responses, timeouts, or commitments inside one user-accessible batch, and make `on_accept` apply a privileged purchase, tier update, or withdrawal action from the wrong source module so `the trusted source of bandwidth governance or purchase messages` becomes inconsistent with `the exact Hyperbridge module that is allowed to issue that action`, breaking the invariant that cross-chain bandwidth actions must authenticate both source chain and source module before changing credit or withdrawing assets and leading to Critical: unauthenticated cross-chain governance or host-management execution?

## Target
- File/function: modules/pallets/bandwidth/src/lib.rs::on_accept
- Entrypoint: BandwidthManager.purchase(...) -> pallet_ismp::handle_unsigned(origin=None, messages)
- Attacker controls: authenticated purchase messages, app and chain identifiers, tier configuration values, and replay ordering
- Exploit idea: Apply a privileged purchase, tier update, or withdrawal action from the wrong source module. Use a batch with one honest item and one duplicated or reordered item to see whether unique-item assumptions collapse.
- Invariant to test: cross-chain bandwidth actions must authenticate both source chain and source module before changing credit or withdrawing assets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: unauthenticated cross-chain governance or host-management execution.
- Fast validation: Route a valid-looking message from the wrong Hyperbridge source module and assert no tier change, withdrawal, or credit mutation occurs. Write a focused batch test with repeated indices or commitments and assert only unique authenticated items can affect state.
