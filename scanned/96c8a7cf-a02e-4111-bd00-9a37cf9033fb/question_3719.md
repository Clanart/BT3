# Q3719: Break reimbursement recoverability in send_watchtower_challenge

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with crafted the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests so `send_watchtower_challenge` moves the protocol past the point where reimbursement should remain recoverable, leaving the verifier nonce session that a final signature is supposed to consume inconsistent with the assumption that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, and leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/states/kickoff.rs::send_watchtower_challenge
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the aggregate nonce / partial-signature sequencing across repeated requests
- Exploit idea: move bridge state forward while reimbursement/slashability stays tied to older state
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
