# Q303: NEAR wNEAR unwrap path asset-branch confusion on finalization via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public finalize and fast-transfer payouts when the token is `wnear_account_id` and `msg` is empty` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens wNEAR branch` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `asset-branch confusion on finalization` under unwraps wNEAR with one yocto deposit and then forwards raw NEAR to the recipient in a callback, violating `wNEAR unwrapping must not let attackers trigger a payout path that spends wrapped liquidity while leaving the associated transfer finalization unsettled or replayable`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens wNEAR branch`
- Entrypoint: `public finalize and fast-transfer payouts when the token is `wnear_account_id` and `msg` is empty`
- Attacker controls: token id chosen through mapping, recipient account, amount, and callback success/failure
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: wNEAR unwrapping must not let attackers trigger a payout path that spends wrapped liquidity while leaving the associated transfer finalization unsettled or replayable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
