# Q241: EVM ENearProxy burn burn or lock before irreversible state via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public bridge-side burn path behind `MINTER_ROLE` but used by outbound bridge flows` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `evm/src/eNear/contracts/ENearProxy.sol::burn` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `burn or lock before irreversible state` under calls `eNear.transferToNear` after asserting the token address is the configured eNEAR token, violating `legacy outbound burns must not let attackers create Near-side withdrawal claims without consuming the exact on-chain eNEAR balance once`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/eNear/contracts/ENearProxy.sol::burn`
- Entrypoint: `public bridge-side burn path behind `MINTER_ROLE` but used by outbound bridge flows`
- Attacker controls: token address and amount
- Exploit idea: Look for branches where custody changes happen before the final pending-state, mapping, or callback outcome is fixed. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: legacy outbound burns must not let attackers create Near-side withdrawal claims without consuming the exact on-chain eNEAR balance once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Model failures between custody changes and state writes, then assert that no branch both consumes user value and allows the transfer to be replayed or dropped. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
