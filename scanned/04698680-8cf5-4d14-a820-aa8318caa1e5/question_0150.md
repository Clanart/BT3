# Q0150: redirect_to_login: A POST whose `request.referer` URI is attacker-chosen, driving ...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`return_to`, `shop`, `host`, the Referer header, and arbitrary extra query params) reach `redirect_to_login / return_to_url / login_url_params` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb via GET a protected action while unauthenticated (triggers redirect_to_login), supplying a POST whose `request.referer` URI is attacker-chosen, driving `path`/`query` in `return_to_url` on non-GET, so that attacker Referer/params must not silently choose the shop the login flow authorizes is violated, leading to authorization to an attacker-chosen shop (cross-shop access)? Specifically confirm that a wrong-secret or tampered artifact is always rejected before any side effect.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb — `redirect_to_login / return_to_url / login_url_params`
- Entrypoint: GET a protected action while unauthenticated (triggers redirect_to_login)
- Attacker controls: `return_to`, `shop`, `host`, the Referer header, and arbitrary extra query params — specifically a POST whose `request.referer` URI is attacker-chosen, driving `path`/`query` in `return_to_url` on non-GET.
- Exploit idea: Run the exact flow with a deliberately-wrong secret/signature/token to prove verification actually rejects it.
- Invariant to test: attacker Referer/params must not silently choose the shop the login flow authorizes
- Expected Immunefi impact: authorization to an attacker-chosen shop (cross-shop access) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: negative-control test asserting a wrong-secret/wrong-signature/tampered-token request is rejected with no side effect.
