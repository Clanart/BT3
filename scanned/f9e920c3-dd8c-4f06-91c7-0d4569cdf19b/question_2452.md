# Q2452: NEAR deploy_token entry malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public `deploy_token` proof-submission flow` with boundary-controlled inputs covering decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token` violate `one remote asset and one metadata event must map to one canonical token deployment with coherent decimals and storage accounting` in the `malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity` attack class because verifies a metadata proof and forwards the attached deposit into `deploy_token_callback` to deploy a wrapped or native bridge token on Near becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::deploy_token`
- Entrypoint: `public `deploy_token` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and timing relative to other token deployments
- Exploit idea: Exploit arbitrary token metadata calls, old/new ABI switching, or malformed strings in metadata proofs. Concentrate on decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges.
- Invariant to test: one remote asset and one metadata event must map to one canonical token deployment with coherent decimals and storage accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Publish or prove pathological metadata values and assert that downstream deployment and mapping logic still binds to the right remote asset and decimals. Sweep boundary values for decimal caps, zero values, and normalization edges and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
