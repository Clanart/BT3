# Q833: try_lock_accounts_with_results sysvar snapshot drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `try_lock_accounts_with_results` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with duplicated writable/read-only aliases, address lookup tables, and batched conflicting write sets such that clock, rent, blockhash, or slot-hash values observed here can drift relative to the state later committed, breaking the invariant that a transaction should observe one coherent sysvar snapshot for its admitted execution context and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::try_lock_accounts_with_results
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: duplicated writable/read-only aliases, address lookup tables, and batched conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: search for split sysvar snapshots across one processing lifecycle
- Invariant to test: a transaction should observe one coherent sysvar snapshot for its admitted execution context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace sysvar values at admission, execution, and commit
