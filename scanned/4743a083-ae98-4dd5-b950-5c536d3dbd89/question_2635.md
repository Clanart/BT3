# Q2635: read_only_accounts_cache.load slot-removal liveness bug

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that repeatedly fetch recently changed accounts with rapid read-after-write patterns against the same accounts so that slot-removal logic can discard account data still needed by later state resolution, breaking the invariant that slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs::load
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that repeatedly fetch recently changed accounts
- Attacker controls: rapid read-after-write patterns against the same accounts
- Exploit idea: target old/new slot overlap for the same pubkey
- Invariant to test: slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn one pubkey across removable and non-removable slots
