# Q2275: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.withdraw - balance() and totalStaked() read a different ledger than the payout

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol: balance(address) and totalStaked() read MasterMagpie stakingInfo and the receipt token supply, while withdraw pays a Wombat deposit-token balance delta, so the accounting a user sees and the value they receive come from unrelated sources. Under the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, is there an unprivileged sequence of `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` that leaves `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` unreconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`, violates the invariant that the balance a user is shown must be the exact basis on which their withdrawal is priced, and delivers Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: balance() and totalStaked() read a different ledger than the payout)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check
- Exploit idea: balance(address) and totalStaked() read MasterMagpie stakingInfo and the receipt token supply, while withdraw pays a Wombat deposit-token balance delta, so the accounting a user sees and the value they receive come from unrelated sources. Precondition: the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction.
- Invariant to test: the balance a user is shown must be the exact basis on which their withdrawal is priced; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` sequence atomically under the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, asserting at the end that `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` still equals `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
