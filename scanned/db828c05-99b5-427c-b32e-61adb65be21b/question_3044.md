# Q3044: Corrupt work or canonical ordering in fetch_new_blocks_forward

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering so `fetch_new_blocks_forward` computes or compares work / ordering incorrectly, causing the wrong canonical chain or watchtower result to win, corrupting the canonical header-chain state and total work and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/bitcoin_syncer.rs::fetch_new_blocks_forward
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Exploit idea: make the wrong chain or watchtower result win by shaping the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
