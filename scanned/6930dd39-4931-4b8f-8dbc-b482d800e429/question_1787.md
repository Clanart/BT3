# Q1787: translate_instruction_c status visibility race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `translate_instruction_c` by submit transactions that perform cpi with nested instruction payloads, duplicated accounts, signer seeds, and edge-case account lists such that signature or execution status may become externally visible before the underlying state is durably consistent, breaking the invariant that externally visible status must track durable runtime state transitions and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/cpi.rs::translate_instruction_c
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that perform CPI
- Attacker controls: nested instruction payloads, duplicated accounts, signer seeds, and edge-case account lists
- Exploit idea: surface an impossible early success/failure state
- Invariant to test: externally visible status must track durable runtime state transitions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare status-cache visibility to actual commit points under repeated retries
