# Q1556: native_invoke_signed writeback ordering

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `native_invoke_signed` by submit transactions that perform cpi with instruction ordering, signer seeds, duplicated account metas, writable/read-only aliasing, and nested cpi depth such that writes can land in a different order than the logic assumed when computing fees, locks, or state deltas, breaking the invariant that writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs::native_invoke_signed
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that perform CPI
- Attacker controls: instruction ordering, signer seeds, duplicated account metas, writable/read-only aliasing, and nested CPI depth
- Exploit idea: search for ordering dependencies that break under batching or CPI
- Invariant to test: writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace write order and derived counters under multi-instruction, multi-CPI transactions
