# Q3602: Replay context into citrea_reveal_rbf_bumpfee_increases_feerate_and_mines

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync with attacker-controlled light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes so `citrea_reveal_rbf_bumpfee_increases_feerate_and_mines` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the light-client proof context tied to a specific Bitcoin block to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/tests.rs::citrea_reveal_rbf_bumpfee_increases_feerate_and_mines
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
