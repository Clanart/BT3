# Q1125: execute_keccak message replay or skip in execution/syscall_impls.cairo (boundary-value edge)

## Question
Can a malicious Cairo contract reached from a valid user transaction, using attacker-chosen syscall inputs use message payloads, message ordering, message-triggered calldata, storage keys and values reachable from attacker-owned contracts, selector, calldata length to make `execute_keccak` in `crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/syscall_impls.cairo` consume or emit an L1/L2 message under a key, payload, or ordering that is not the same one earlier checked or later committed around L1/L2 message uniqueness and accounting, so that honest StarkNet OS execution commits, emits, or accepts an attacker-favorable result that reaches direct loss of funds? Specifically, can boundary field values, empty/non-empty transitions, or zero-special-case branches trigger the discrepancy?

## Target
- File/function: crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/syscall_impls.cairo:919 :: execute_keccak
- Entrypoint: malicious Cairo contract reached from a valid user transaction, using attacker-chosen syscall inputs
- Attacker controls: message payloads, message ordering, message-triggered calldata, storage keys and values reachable from attacker-owned contracts, selector, calldata length
- Exploit idea: make message uniqueness depend on one header/payload view while output serialization or consumption uses another while this function is handling L1/L2 message uniqueness and accounting. Use attacker-chosen boundary values, zero sentinels, and empty/non-empty transitions to hit the sharp branch in this path.
- Invariant to test: a message must be consumed or emitted exactly once under one canonical header/payload hash and must not be skipped, duplicated, or rebound to a different destination Boundary values and zero-special-case handling must preserve the same security and accounting invariant as ordinary values.
- Expected bounty impact: Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: exercise attacker-controlled payload lengths, nested calls, and revert edges through this function, then assert the message ledger/output contains exactly one canonical effect per accepted message Add a focused fuzz harness around zero, max-sized, empty, and single-element cases and assert the same invariant still holds.
