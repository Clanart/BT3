# Q2964: resolve-dia via call-ststx-ratio: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched reach `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident, the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `resolve-dia` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
