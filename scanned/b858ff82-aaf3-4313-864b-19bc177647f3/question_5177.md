# Q5177: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.depositLP - safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, is there an unprivileged sequence of `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` that leaves `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` unreconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`, violates the invariant that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent, and delivers High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount
- Exploit idea: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Precondition: the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction.
- Invariant to test: an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` sequence atomically under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, asserting at the end that `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` still equals `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
