# Q3596: WombatPoolHelperV2.harvest - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `harvest()` while a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, and drive `pid cached at construction` out of agreement with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` - breaking the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding - for High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the harvest timing for the whole pool
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `harvest()`: constrain the setup so that a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, fuzz the attacker inputs (the harvest timing for the whole pool), and assert after every call that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding.
