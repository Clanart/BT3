# Q996: NEAR cross-chain token-address parsing canonical token identity collision via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public deploy/finalize/proof paths` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `near/omni-types token/address parsing via proofs and deployment flows` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `canonical token identity collision` under token identity is reconstructed from chain-specific address encodings before mapping to Near token ids, violating `token-address parsing must not admit aliases that let one foreign asset reuse another asset’s Near token mapping or lock bucket`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-types token/address parsing via proofs and deployment flows`
- Entrypoint: `public deploy/finalize/proof paths`
- Attacker controls: foreign token addresses, chain tags, and textual or binary address forms
- Exploit idea: Target hashed token ids, deterministic synthetic addresses, PDA seeds, and address-to-token maps. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: token-address parsing must not admit aliases that let one foreign asset reuse another asset’s Near token mapping or lock bucket
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Search for collisions and alias conditions and assert that two distinct remote assets cannot share one local token identity or mapping row. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
