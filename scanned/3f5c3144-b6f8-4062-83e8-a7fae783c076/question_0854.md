# Q854: Race send_citrea_tx across concurrent state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch, retry, or reorder public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction interactions around the ordering of repeated enqueue / replace / cancel requests so `send_citrea_tx` observes inconsistent state across memory, database, and on-chain checks, breaking the invariant that queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent, and leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/tx-sender-jsonrpc-client/src/lib.rs::send_citrea_tx
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the ordering of repeated enqueue / replace / cancel requests
- Exploit idea: use retries, batching, or timing around the ordering of repeated enqueue / replace / cancel requests to desynchronize state
- Invariant to test: queued tx metadata, fee paths, and dependency sets must all describe the same transaction intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
