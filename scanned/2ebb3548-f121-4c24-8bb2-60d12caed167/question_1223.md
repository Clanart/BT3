# Q1223: request_payment: A `return_url = ...?shop=#{shop}&host=#{host}` built from `sess...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`shop`/`host` params that flow into the billing return_url and confirmation redirect) reach `request_payment / check_billing redirect` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/ensure_billing.rb via GET a billing-gated action without active payment, supplying a `return_url = ...?shop=#{shop}&host=#{host}` built from `session.shop` where shop is attacker-influenced, so that billing redirect/return URLs must be bound to the app + verified shop origin is violated, leading to open redirect via billing confirmation flow? Specifically confirm that the full public-route flow yields only a rejection or attacker-own-scope result.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/ensure_billing.rb — `request_payment / check_billing redirect`
- Entrypoint: GET a billing-gated action without active payment
- Attacker controls: `shop`/`host` params that flow into the billing return_url and confirmation redirect — specifically a `return_url = ...?shop=#{shop}&host=#{host}` built from `session.shop` where shop is attacker-influenced.
- Exploit idea: Run the full public route end-to-end with the crafted input and confirm the real-world outcome is safe.
- Invariant to test: billing redirect/return URLs must be bound to the app + verified shop origin
- Expected Immunefi impact: open redirect via billing confirmation flow (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: end-to-end integration test through the real route asserting the attacker outcome is a reject/own-scope only.
