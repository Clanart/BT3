# Q4364: is-healthy-with-mask via collateral-remove-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver` for the underlying leg reach `is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) in a state where it satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? Given that it resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `receiver` for the underlying leg varied, and assert that the value `is-healthy-with-mask` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
