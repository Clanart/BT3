# Q318: Accept wrong proof/network context in citrea_large_body_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions through user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync so `citrea_large_body_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the light-client proof context tied to a specific Bitcoin block and breaking the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/tests.rs::citrea_large_body_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
