# Q229: NEAR token-deployer deploy_token canonical token identity collision via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `cross-contract token deployment reached from public Near `deploy_token` callback` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/token-deployer/src/lib.rs::deploy_token` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `canonical token identity collision` under controller-only deployer creates a new token subaccount and initializes metadata that downstream bridge flows will trust as canonical, violating `deployment into a predictable subaccount must not let an attacker reuse state, collide names, or create a token whose runtime semantics diverge from the bridge’s assumed wrapped-token model`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/token-deployer/src/lib.rs::deploy_token`
- Entrypoint: `cross-contract token deployment reached from public Near `deploy_token` callback`
- Attacker controls: account id chosen for the new token, metadata supplied by a validated bridge proof, and global code hash state
- Exploit idea: Target hashed token ids, deterministic synthetic addresses, PDA seeds, and address-to-token maps. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: deployment into a predictable subaccount must not let an attacker reuse state, collide names, or create a token whose runtime semantics diverge from the bridge’s assumed wrapped-token model
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Search for collisions and alias conditions and assert that two distinct remote assets cannot share one local token identity or mapping row. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
