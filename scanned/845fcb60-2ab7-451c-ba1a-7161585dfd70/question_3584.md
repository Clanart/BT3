# Q3584: Drive state split inside work_conversion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation with crafted reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height so `work_conversion` updates one canonical value while another subsystem retains the older one for the same event, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and breaking the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/work_only/mod.rs::work_conversion
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: update one canonical value while another subsystem keeps the old one for the same event via reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
