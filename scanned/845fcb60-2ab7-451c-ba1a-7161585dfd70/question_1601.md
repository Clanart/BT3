# Q1601: Leave reusable partial state in create_round_txhandler

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker force a partial failure around the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering and then resume public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `create_round_txhandler` continues from stale intermediate state, causing the nofn aggregate key and covenant context to diverge from the canonical bridge context and breaking the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/builder/transaction/operator_collateral.rs::create_round_txhandler
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure around the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering and then resume under changed state
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
