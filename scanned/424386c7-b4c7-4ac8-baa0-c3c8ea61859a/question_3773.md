# Q3773: create via liquidate-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the borrower targeted, drive `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) — which binds a principal to a fresh numeric id — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the borrower targeted, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
