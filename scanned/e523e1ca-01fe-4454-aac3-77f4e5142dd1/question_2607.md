# Q2607: NEAR bind_token entry fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public `bind_token` proof-submission flow` to register or settle against a token that only looks bridge-controlled because `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token` relies on verifies a deploy-token proof, writes token mappings in `bind_token_callback`, then refunds leftover deposit in a second callback, violating `binding an existing Near token to a foreign asset must remain one-to-one and fully collateral-accounted across proof replay, partial failure, and refund paths`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token`
- Entrypoint: `public `bind_token` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and timing versus token deployment
- Exploit idea: Target checks that only inspect mint authority, owner, or one mapping row without proving the full asset identity.
- Invariant to test: binding an existing Near token to a foreign asset must remain one-to-one and fully collateral-accounted across proof replay, partial failure, and refund paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Construct plausible fake bridge-controlled assets and assert that deployment, settlement, and forwarding reject them unless they are the canonical mapping for that remote asset.
