# Q4827: WombatPoolHelper.depositLP - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Starting from a state where an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, can an unprivileged EOA use `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` to leave `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` inconsistent with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`, violating the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding and extracting High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` sequence atomically under an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, asserting at the end that `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` still equals `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
