# Q5831: increment via supply-collateral-add: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) advances the user-id nonce. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `amount`, use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
