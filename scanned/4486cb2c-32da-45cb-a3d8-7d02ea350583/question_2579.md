# Q2579: Duplicate queue or processing state in prove_genesis_block

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `prove_genesis_block` twice with attacker-controlled reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the canonical header-chain state and total work and violating the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/header_chain_prover.rs::prove_genesis_block
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
