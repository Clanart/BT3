# Q2126: spawn_stake_weighted_qos_server writeback ordering

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `spawn_stake_weighted_qos_server` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one client with connection counts, packet pacing, payload sizes, and unstaked-versus-staked looking client identities such that writes can land in a different order than the logic assumed when computing fees, locks, or state deltas, breaking the invariant that writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/quic.rs::spawn_stake_weighted_qos_server
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one client
- Attacker controls: connection counts, packet pacing, payload sizes, and unstaked-versus-staked looking client identities
- Exploit idea: search for ordering dependencies that break under batching or CPI
- Invariant to test: writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace write order and derived counters under multi-instruction, multi-CPI transactions
