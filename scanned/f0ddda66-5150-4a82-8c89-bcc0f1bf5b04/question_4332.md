# Q4332: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.withdraw - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
Note that in wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` under the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body and force `pid cached at construction` apart from `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, breaking the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding for High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, have the attacker run `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `pid cached at construction` versus `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
