# Q4807: MasterMagpie.deposit - lpSupply inflation by direct token donation

## Question
Note that in rewards/MasterMagpie.sol, _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `deposit(address _stakingToken, uint256 _amount)` under the staking token is a Wombat receipt token minted by WombatStaking with 18 decimals and force `IBaseRewardPool(rewarder).balanceOf(user)` apart from `IBaseRewardPool(rewarder).totalStaked()`, breaking the invariant that MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply for High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `deposit(address _stakingToken, uint256 _amount)` (mechanism: lpSupply inflation by direct token donation)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(address _stakingToken, uint256 _amount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _stakingToken, _amount, and the ERC20 the pool was registered with
- Exploit idea: _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Precondition: the staking token is a Wombat receipt token minted by WombatStaking with 18 decimals.
- Invariant to test: MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply; concretely, `IBaseRewardPool(rewarder).balanceOf(user)` must stay reconciled with `IBaseRewardPool(rewarder).totalStaked()`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the staking token is a Wombat receipt token minted by WombatStaking with 18 decimals, then assert `IBaseRewardPool(rewarder).balanceOf(user)` and `IBaseRewardPool(rewarder).totalStaked()` end identical in both runs.
