# Q4526: WombatPoolHelperV2.harvest - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `harvest()` under the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body and force `pid cached at construction` apart from `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, breaking the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value for Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `harvest()` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvest()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the harvest timing for the whole pool
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, snapshot `pid cached at construction` and `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, run the attacker's `harvest()` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
