# Q3049: process_notifications cleanup drops live state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_notifications` by trigger many hot notifications from one subscription shape with subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams so that cleanup or compaction can discard still-live attacker-controlled account state, breaking the invariant that live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::process_notifications
- Entrypoint: trigger many hot notifications from one subscription shape
- Attacker controls: subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams
- Exploit idea: look for mistaken liveness decisions under fast churn
- Invariant to test: live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn many attacker-owned accounts through close/recreate/update cycles
