# Q4166: zip via call-ststx-ratio: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `call-ststx-ratio` twice with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block varied, and assert that the value `zip` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
