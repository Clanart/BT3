# Q4332: iter-find-superset via borrow: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `iter-find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it short-circuits on the first superset match, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:267` -> `iter-find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `iter-find-superset` short-circuits on the first superset match. Reach it through `borrow` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `iter-find-superset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
