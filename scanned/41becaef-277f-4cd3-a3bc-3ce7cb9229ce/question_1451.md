# Q1451: process_and_record_transactions CPI signer confusion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_and_record_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transaction batches, conflicting write sets, duplicate signatures, fee-payer edge cases, and cpi-heavy payloads such that nested invocation state lets attacker-controlled signer or writable flags be translated inconsistently, breaking the invariant that cpi must preserve signer and writable semantics exactly and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/banking_stage/consumer.rs::process_and_record_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transaction batches, conflicting write sets, duplicate signatures, fee-payer edge cases, and CPI-heavy payloads
- Exploit idea: look for ways to gain authority or write access through CPI translation mismatches
- Invariant to test: CPI must preserve signer and writable semantics exactly
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: build nested CPI graphs with repeated accounts and diff signer/writable sets at each level
