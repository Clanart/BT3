# Q4921: call-liquidate via liquidate-multi: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), drive `call-liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907) — which invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot — to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, breaking the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907` -> `call-liquidate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `call-liquidate` invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), then read `call-liquidate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
