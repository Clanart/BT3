# Q1251: Solana init_transfer_sol burn or lock before irreversible state at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Solana `init_transfer_sol` instruction` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_sol` violate `native-SOL outbound flows must not emit claims whose amount or fee exceeds the value actually escrowing or burning on Solana` in the `burn or lock before irreversible state` attack class because handles outbound native-SOL bridging while still posting the same class of Near-bound transfer payload becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_sol`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `init_transfer_sol` instruction`
- Attacker controls: payer lamports, recipient string, amount, fee, native fee, and message
- Exploit idea: Look for branches where custody changes happen before the final pending-state, mapping, or callback outcome is fixed. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: native-SOL outbound flows must not emit claims whose amount or fee exceeds the value actually escrowing or burning on Solana
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Model failures between custody changes and state writes, then assert that no branch both consumes user value and allows the transfer to be replayed or dropped. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
