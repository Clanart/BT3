# Q1619: current_shopify_session: A mismatched `session` param vs `current_shopify_session.shopif...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` URL param, the Authorization: Bearer header, `shop`, `host`, `session`, and the encrypted session cookie value) reach `current_shopify_session / load_current_session` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb via GET any EnsureHasSession-protected controller action (legacy auth strategy), supplying a mismatched `session` param vs `current_shopify_session.shopify_session_id` to probe `session_id_conflicts_with_params`, so that the activated session must belong to the shop/user proven by a verified id_token, not by an unverified cookie or param is violated, leading to session fixation / use of another merchant's session (unauthorized data access)? Specifically confirm that the activated session binds to the verified token's shop/user, never a disagreeing cookie/param.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb — `current_shopify_session / load_current_session`
- Entrypoint: GET any EnsureHasSession-protected controller action (legacy auth strategy)
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` URL param, the Authorization: Bearer header, `shop`, `host`, `session`, and the encrypted session cookie value — specifically a mismatched `session` param vs `current_shopify_session.shopify_session_id` to probe `session_id_conflicts_with_params`.
- Exploit idea: Present a cookie and a token that disagree on shop/user and confirm the verified token wins, not the cookie.
- Invariant to test: the activated session must belong to the shop/user proven by a verified id_token, not by an unverified cookie or param
- Expected Immunefi impact: session fixation / use of another merchant's session (unauthorized data access) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: test with a mismatched cookie/token pair asserting the session binds to the verified token's shop/user only.
