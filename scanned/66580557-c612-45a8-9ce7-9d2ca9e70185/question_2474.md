# Q2474: generate_index cleanup drops live state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `generate_index` by submit transactions that create many attacker-controlled accounts with structured keys with many-account creation with common owners/layouts and repeated indexed reads so that cleanup or compaction can discard still-live attacker-controlled account state, breaking the invariant that live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::generate_index
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that create many attacker-controlled accounts with structured keys
- Attacker controls: many-account creation with common owners/layouts and repeated indexed reads
- Exploit idea: look for mistaken liveness decisions under fast churn
- Invariant to test: live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn many attacker-owned accounts through close/recreate/update cycles
