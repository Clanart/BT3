# Q258: Accept wrong proof/network context in parse_op_return_data

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof through broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation so `parse_op_return_data` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/mod.rs::parse_op_return_data
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
