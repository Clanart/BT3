# Q2297: Keeper.PostTxProcessing - Hook State Changes Commit While Evm Result Reports Failure

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call a malicious contract from an unprivileged EOA through `post-EVM hooks after successful transaction execution` while controlling `gas limit` and `contract creation flag`, under the precondition that the same Cosmos tx contains multiple Ethereum messages, drive `ApplyMessageWithConfig -> Prepare -> EVM CALL/CREATE -> gas/refund calculation -> StateDB.Commit` in `x/evm/keeper/keeper.go::Keeper.PostTxProcessing` so that hook state changes commit while EVM result reports failure, violating the invariant that simulation and committed execution must only differ by persistence, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/keeper.go::Keeper.PostTxProcessing`
- Entrypoint: `post-EVM hooks after successful transaction execution`
- Attacker controls: `gas limit`, `contract creation flag`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: hook state changes commit while EVM result reports failure through `ApplyMessageWithConfig -> Prepare -> EVM CALL/CREATE -> gas/refund calculation -> StateDB.Commit`.
- Invariant to test: simulation and committed execution must only differ by persistence.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: add a fuzz case varying the attacker-controlled fields and differential-check against go-ethereum for tx validity, gas, nonce, and code/storage effects.
