# Q3399: WombatBribeManager.castVotes - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
In wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `castVotes(bool swapForBnb)` while the pool the attacker voted for has been deactivated so unvote reverts, and drive `targetVote computed in castVotes` out of agreement with `totalVotes() from veWom.balanceOf(wombatStaking)` - breaking the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates - for Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `castVotes(bool swapForBnb)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `castVotes(bool swapForBnb)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the exact block at which every pending vote is pushed to Wombat and every bribe is harvested, plus the caller fee destination
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the pool the attacker voted for has been deactivated so unvote reverts.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `targetVote computed in castVotes` must stay reconciled with `totalVotes() from veWom.balanceOf(wombatStaking)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the pool the attacker voted for has been deactivated so unvote reverts, snapshot `targetVote computed in castVotes` and `totalVotes() from veWom.balanceOf(wombatStaking)`, run the attacker's `castVotes(bool swapForBnb)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
