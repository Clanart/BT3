# Q0126: BaseRewardPool.updateFor - _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles

## Question
Note that in rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol, _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `updateFor(address _account)` under the pool has exactly one registered reward token and no queued backlog and force `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` apart from `earned(account,_rewardToken)`, breaking the invariant that a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol -> `updateFor(address _account)` (mechanism: _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `updateFor(address _account)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Precondition: the pool has exactly one registered reward token and no queued backlog.
- Invariant to test: a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered; concretely, `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` must stay reconciled with `earned(account,_rewardToken)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the pool has exactly one registered reward token and no queued backlog, call `updateFor(address _account)`, and assert `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` equals `earned(account,_rewardToken)` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
