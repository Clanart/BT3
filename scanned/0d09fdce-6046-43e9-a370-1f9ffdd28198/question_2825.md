# Q2825: remove_slots_le load/store torn read

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove_slots_le` by submit transactions that churn the same pubkeys across old and new slots with same-pubkey churn across slots plus cleanup pressure so that one caller can read a mix of pre-update and post-update fields because load and store paths disagree on version boundaries, breaking the invariant that one account read must resolve to one coherent version of that account and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::remove_slots_le
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that churn the same pubkeys across old and new slots
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey churn across slots plus cleanup pressure
- Exploit idea: seek field-level incoherence, not just old-vs-new whole values
- Invariant to test: one account read must resolve to one coherent version of that account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: diff lamports, data length, owner, and payload fields returned by immediate read-after-write patterns
