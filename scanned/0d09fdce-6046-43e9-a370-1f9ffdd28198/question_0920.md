# Q920: simulate_transaction_unchecked reserved-key bypass

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `simulate_transaction_unchecked` by json-rpc `simulatetransaction` with serialized transaction bytes, account-request config, sigverify / replacerecentblockhash flags, and cpi-heavy programs such that duplicated accounts or versioned message features let attacker-controlled keys slip past reserved-key assumptions, breaking the invariant that reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::simulate_transaction_unchecked
- Entrypoint: JSON-RPC `simulateTransaction`
- Attacker controls: serialized transaction bytes, account-request config, sigVerify / replaceRecentBlockhash flags, and CPI-heavy programs
- Exploit idea: search for paths where reserved-key checks see a different key set than execution
- Invariant to test: reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: construct versioned transactions whose ALT-expanded account set changes the effective key view
