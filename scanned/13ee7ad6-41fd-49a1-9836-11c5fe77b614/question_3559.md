# Q3559: Starknet bridge-token upgrade coupling fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public bridge activity that depends on upgraded token implementations` with control over token address chosen from the bridge map and any transfer state that spans pre/post upgrade token classes and desynchronize `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::upgrade_token plus bridge_token.cairo::upgrade` from the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical` attack class because bridge token upgrades are admin-gated, but public settlement and outbound flows depend on the assumption that token logic before and after upgrade preserves burn/mint invariants, violating `public bridge flows must not become exploitable through an implementation mismatch that changes supply semantics for already-mapped tokens`?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::upgrade_token plus bridge_token.cairo::upgrade`
- Entrypoint: `public bridge activity that depends on upgraded token implementations`
- Attacker controls: token address chosen from the bridge map and any transfer state that spans pre/post upgrade token classes
- Exploit idea: Target checks that only inspect mint authority, owner, or one mapping row without proving the full asset identity. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting.
- Invariant to test: public bridge flows must not become exploitable through an implementation mismatch that changes supply semantics for already-mapped tokens
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Construct plausible fake bridge-controlled assets and assert that deployment, settlement, and forwarding reject them unless they are the canonical mapping for that remote asset. Also assert cross-module consistency between `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::upgrade_token plus bridge_token.cairo::upgrade` and the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting after every branch.
