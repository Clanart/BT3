# Q887: NEAR Wormhole ParsedVAA::parse missing chain or contract domain separation via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Wormhole proof flow through `verify_proof -> verify_vaa_callback`` and then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint so that `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/parsed_vaa.rs::ParsedVAA::parse` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `missing chain or contract domain separation` under parses the VAA header/body offsets, hashes the body, and slices out timestamp, nonce, emitter chain/address, sequence, and payload, violating `byte slicing and offset arithmetic must never let malformed VAAs shift field boundaries or produce a locally-accepted payload different from the guardian-approved body`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/parsed_vaa.rs::ParsedVAA::parse`
- Entrypoint: `public Wormhole proof flow through `verify_proof -> verify_vaa_callback``
- Attacker controls: raw VAA bytes, signer count, body offsets, emitter fields, payload length, and consistency level
- Exploit idea: Target validators keyed by derived signer, block hash, emitter address, or payload bytes that omit some domain field. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: byte slicing and offset arithmetic must never let malformed VAAs shift field boundaries or produce a locally-accepted payload different from the guardian-approved body
- Expected Immunefi impact: Light client verification bypass
- Fast validation: Attempt cross-chain and cross-contract replay of the same validated bytes and assert that every trust domain field participates in acceptance. Then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
