# Q225: NEAR OmniToken burn burn or lock before irreversible state via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public bridge-token burn path via controller-only callback reached from outbound bridge flows` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `near/omni-token/src/lib.rs::burn` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `burn or lock before irreversible state` under controller-only burn always withdraws from `env::predecessor_account_id()` rather than an explicit account parameter, violating `outbound burning must always debit the exact bridged balance that backs the emitted bridge event and must not depend on an attacker-rebindable predecessor context`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-token/src/lib.rs::burn`
- Entrypoint: `public bridge-token burn path via controller-only callback reached from outbound bridge flows`
- Attacker controls: amount and predecessor account used as the balance source
- Exploit idea: Look for branches where custody changes happen before the final pending-state, mapping, or callback outcome is fixed. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: outbound burning must always debit the exact bridged balance that backs the emitted bridge event and must not depend on an attacker-rebindable predecessor context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Model failures between custody changes and state writes, then assert that no branch both consumes user value and allows the transfer to be replayed or dropped. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
