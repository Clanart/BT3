# Q1540: mask-to-list-collateral via liquidate-multi: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
