# Q3047: process_notifications index inconsistency

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_notifications` by trigger many hot notifications from one subscription shape with subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams so that indexes or lookup tables updated around this function can disagree with the stored account payloads they point to, breaking the invariant that indexes must resolve to the exact account version later returned to rpc or runtime callers and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::process_notifications
- Entrypoint: trigger many hot notifications from one subscription shape
- Attacker controls: subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams
- Exploit idea: force same-pubkey and same-owner churn to look for torn index state
- Invariant to test: indexes must resolve to the exact account version later returned to RPC or runtime callers
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare indexed reads to direct storage reads during high-churn updates
