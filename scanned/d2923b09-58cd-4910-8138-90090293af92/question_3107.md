# Q3107: filter_block_result_txs premature frozen-slot assumption

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_block_result_txs` by use in-scope block subscriptions and hot block contents with block subscription filters, detail levels, and hot block streams so that this path can treat a slot as finalized for one purpose before all related account state is safely written, breaking the invariant that frozen-slot assumptions must not outpace actual durable state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_block_result_txs
- Entrypoint: use in-scope block subscriptions and hot block contents
- Attacker controls: block subscription filters, detail levels, and hot block streams
- Exploit idea: search for early frozen assumptions
- Invariant to test: frozen-slot assumptions must not outpace actual durable state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace slot-freeze transitions and storage durability
