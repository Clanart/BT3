# Q2047: netlink_get_interfaces confuses account types or owners (netlink.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `netlink_get_interfaces` in `xdp/src/netlink.rs` with a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one, and have `netlink_get_interfaces` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`netlink_get_interfaces` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `xdp/src/netlink.rs` -> `netlink_get_interfaces()` (around line 420)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a key that exists on an ancestor fork but not the current one
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `netlink_get_interfaces` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `netlink_get_interfaces` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `netlink_get_interfaces` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy a program that reads or writes host/guest memory outside its permitted regions, or forges an account reference, and extracts or corrupts state belonging to other accounts.
