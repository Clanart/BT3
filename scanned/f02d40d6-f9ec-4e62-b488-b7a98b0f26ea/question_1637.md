# Q1637: Exploit witness/annex edge cases in save_unproven_block_cache

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit witness, annex, or script-path edge cases in the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values so `save_unproven_block_cache` verifies a different Bitcoin statement than later settlement relies on, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/header_chain_prover.rs::save_unproven_block_cache
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Exploit idea: make verification hash a different Bitcoin statement than settlement later uses via the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
