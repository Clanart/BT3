# Q726: Exploit reorg boundary handling in calculate_groth16_public_input

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit reorg timing around Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents so `calculate_groth16_public_input` treats a non-canonical object as canonical long enough to mutate bridge state, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and violating the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/structs.rs::calculate_groth16_public_input
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Exploit idea: reorder or replay Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents across canonical and non-canonical views
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
