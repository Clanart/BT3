# Q3576: Solana finalize response serialization optional string alias changes bridge subject through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public finalize instructions through `FinalizeTransfer::process`` with control over destination nonce, token mint, amount, fee recipient, and transfer id returned toward Near and desynchronize `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/finalize_transfer.rs` from the adjacent the next module that consumes the same asset or transfer id that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `optional string alias changes bridge subject` attack class because serializes a finalize response that Near later uses for fee claims and replay coupling, violating `response serialization must not let Near interpret a finalized Solana event under a different transfer id, amount, or fee recipient than Solana actually executed`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/finalize_transfer.rs`
- Entrypoint: `public finalize instructions through `FinalizeTransfer::process``
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, token mint, amount, fee recipient, and transfer id returned toward Near
- Exploit idea: Focus on optional fee recipients, empty messages, token strings, and recipient strings. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent the next module that consumes the same asset or transfer id.
- Invariant to test: response serialization must not let Near interpret a finalized Solana event under a different transfer id, amount, or fee recipient than Solana actually executed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Cross-parse edge-case strings across all implementations and assert a single canonical meaning for every accepted value. Also assert cross-module consistency between `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/finalize_transfer.rs` and the adjacent the next module that consumes the same asset or transfer id after every branch.
