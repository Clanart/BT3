# Q3708: WombatPoolHelperV2.deposit - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol, none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` under the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes and force `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` apart from `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`, breaking the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard for Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity) under the pool was deactivated in WombatStaking so _onlyActivePoolHelper rejects deposits while withdraw still passes, asserting on every row that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard.
