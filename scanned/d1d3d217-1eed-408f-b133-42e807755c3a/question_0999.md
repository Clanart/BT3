# Q0999: mWOMSVBaseRewarder.getRewards - forfeited value recycled to the same stakers who forfeited it

## Question
rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol: _sendReward() routes forfeitAmount into _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer(), which raises rewardPerTokenStored for everyone currently staked including the forfeiting account, so a dominant staker recovers most of their own forfeit. With the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor under attacker control and the account's slot matured recently so the percent has only just begun to decay, can an unprivileged caller sequence `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` so that `forfeitAmount` and `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that value forfeited on exit must accrue to the users who remained committed, not back to the exiting account and realising High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: forfeited value recycled to the same stakers who forfeited it)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() routes forfeitAmount into _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer(), which raises rewardPerTokenStored for everyone currently staked including the forfeiting account, so a dominant staker recovers most of their own forfeit. Precondition: the account's slot matured recently so the percent has only just begun to decay.
- Invariant to test: value forfeited on exit must accrue to the users who remained committed, not back to the exiting account; concretely, `forfeitAmount` must stay reconciled with `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the account's slot matured recently so the percent has only just begun to decay, snapshot `forfeitAmount` and `rewardInfo.rewardPerTokenStored`, run the attacker's `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
