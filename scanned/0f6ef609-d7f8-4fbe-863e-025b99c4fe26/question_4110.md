# Q4110: accrue-debt-asset via deposit: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `deposit` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `accrue-debt-asset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
