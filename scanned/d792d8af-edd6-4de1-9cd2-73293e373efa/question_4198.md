# Q4198: convert-to-shares-preview via deposit: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling `min-out`, can an unprivileged attacker make `convert-to-shares-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `convert-to-shares-preview` returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308` -> `convert-to-shares-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-shares-preview` returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Reach it through `deposit` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with `min-out`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
