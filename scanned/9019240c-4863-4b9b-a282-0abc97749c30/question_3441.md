# Q3441: output_message_to_l1_hashes block-hash window mismatch in os_utils__virtual.cairo (mode/version split)

## Question
Can a malicious L1-to-L2 message sender controlling the message payload and timing use message payloads, message ordering, message-triggered calldata, declared class contents, entry-point tables, compiled class facts to make `output_message_to_l1_hashes` in `crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/os_utils__virtual.cairo` use boundary block numbers or guessed old-hash values so one honest execution treats a block-hash read as valid while another treats it as stale or unverified around L1/L2 message uniqueness and accounting, so that honest StarkNet OS execution commits, emits, or accepts an attacker-favorable result that reaches unintended chain split / network partition? Can validate/execute mode, deprecated/new code paths, or output-mode switches make honest executions disagree on the same public input?

## Target
- File/function: crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/os_utils__virtual.cairo:15 :: output_message_to_l1_hashes
- Entrypoint: malicious L1-to-L2 message sender controlling the message payload and timing
- Attacker controls: message payloads, message ordering, message-triggered calldata, declared class contents, entry-point tables, compiled class facts
- Exploit idea: exploit the stored block-hash buffer, guessed header fields, or block-hash mapping path to desynchronize honest views of the same block context while this function is handling L1/L2 message uniqueness and accounting. Exploit a mode, version, or output-format split so one phase authorizes a behavior that another phase commits differently.
- Invariant to test: all honest nodes and provers must agree on which historical block hash a given accepted input is allowed to read or prove against All supported modes and versions must preserve one canonical authorization and commitment result for the same accepted public input.
- Expected bounty impact: Unintended chain split / network partition
- Fast validation: exercise block numbers at the storage-buffer edge through this function and assert all honest executions agree on acceptance, returned hash, and committed mapping state Cross-test the old/new or validate/execute variants with the same public input and assert they cannot commit divergent results.
