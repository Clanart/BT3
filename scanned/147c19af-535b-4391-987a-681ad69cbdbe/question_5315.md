# Q5315: from_condition_aborted_contract_call: sponsored fee charged to the wrong account

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `from_condition_aborted_contract_call` (in `stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/transactions.rs`) via a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions), such that the fee is debited from origin instead of sponsor (or vice versa), breaking the invariant that account debited the fee == the sponsor who signed the sponsor auth — leading to unauthorised fee charge?

## Target
- File/function: `stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/transactions.rs` -> `from_condition_aborted_contract_call`
- Entrypoint: a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions)
- Attacker controls: the full auth structure (singlesig/multisig/order-independent/sponsored), nonce, fee, chain id, version, payload, and post-condition list, plus mutation of their own signed transactions
- Exploit idea: the fee is debited from origin instead of sponsor (or vice versa)
- Invariant to test: account debited the fee == the sponsor who signed the sponsor auth
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - unauthorised fee charge
- Fast validation: test a sponsored tx asserting who pays
