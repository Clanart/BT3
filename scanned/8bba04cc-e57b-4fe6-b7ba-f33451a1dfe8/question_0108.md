# Q108: cost commit output after an error path via trusted-block coin spend extraction inputs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call run_block_generator/run_block_generator2 through Rust or Python bindings targeting `cost` in `crates/chia-consensus/src/build_interned_block.rs` with trusted-block coin spend extraction inputs when equivalent-looking encodings are mixed make chia_rs commit output after an error path, violating the invariant that fast-forward output preserves singleton lineage and puzzle hash, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Consensus-valid spend, block generator, proof, or block record path can mint, burn, steal, double-spend, or mis-account Chia coins/rewards/fees?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-consensus/src/build_interned_block.rs:212` / `cost`
- Entrypoint: call run_block_generator/run_block_generator2 through Rust or Python bindings
- Attacker controls: trusted-block coin spend extraction inputs
- Exploit idea: Drive `cost` through its public caller path using trusted-block coin spend extraction inputs; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: fast-forward output preserves singleton lineage and puzzle hash
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Consensus-valid spend, block generator, proof, or block record path can mint, burn, steal, double-spend, or mis-account Chia coins/rewards/fees
- Fast validation: fuzz generator refs/backrefs and assert deterministic output.
