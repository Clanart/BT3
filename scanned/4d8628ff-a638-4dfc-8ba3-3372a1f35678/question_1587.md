# Q1587: prepare_next_cpi_instruction queue fairness break

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `prepare_next_cpi_instruction` by submit transactions that perform cpi with instruction ordering, signer seeds, duplicated account metas, writable/read-only aliasing, and nested cpi depth such that attacker-chosen transactions make this function occupy shared scheduling resources long enough to starve cheaper work, breaking the invariant that one heavy transaction shape must not monopolize shared scheduling resources and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs::prepare_next_cpi_instruction
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that perform CPI
- Attacker controls: instruction ordering, signer seeds, duplicated account metas, writable/read-only aliasing, and nested CPI depth
- Exploit idea: measure unfair occupancy rather than raw throughput
- Invariant to test: one heavy transaction shape must not monopolize shared scheduling resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: replay one heavy shape alongside cheap transfers and compare scheduling latency
