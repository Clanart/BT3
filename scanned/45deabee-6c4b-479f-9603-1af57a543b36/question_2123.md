# Q2123: Substitute a wrong proof path into verify_tar_image_digest_inspect_only

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker substitute part of attacker-controlled the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values so `verify_tar_image_digest_inspect_only` accepts a proof, header, or path that should have been rejected, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/docker.rs::verify_tar_image_digest_inspect_only
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Exploit idea: swap part of attacker-controlled the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values while keeping the rest seemingly valid
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
