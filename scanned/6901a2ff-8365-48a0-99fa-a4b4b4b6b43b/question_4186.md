# Q4186: WombatPoolHelperV2.deposit - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol - none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _amount and _minimumLiquidity, under the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, exploit this through `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` to break the reconciliation between `pid cached at construction` and `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` and the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard, yielding Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`: constrain the setup so that the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, fuzz the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity), and assert after every call that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard.
