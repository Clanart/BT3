# Q2891: status via collateral-remove: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`status` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115) derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115` -> `status`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `status` derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
