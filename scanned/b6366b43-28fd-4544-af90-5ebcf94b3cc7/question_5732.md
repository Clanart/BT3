# Q5732: next-index via collateral-remove-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-underlying` reach `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) in a state where it satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? Given that it returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `min-underlying` varied, and assert that the value `next-index` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
