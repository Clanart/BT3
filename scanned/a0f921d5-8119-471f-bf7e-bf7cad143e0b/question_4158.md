# Q4158: convert-to-assets-preview via supply-collateral-add: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), can an unprivileged attacker make `convert-to-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317` -> `convert-to-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `convert-to-assets-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
