# Q0787: WombatPoolHelperV2.withdraw - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. With _liquidity and _minAmount under attacker control and the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, can an unprivileged caller sequence `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` so that `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` and `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard and realising Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity and _minAmount
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_liquidity and _minAmount) under the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, asserting on every row that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard.
