# Q0696: ManualCompound.compound - helper branch deposits the whole balance for msg.sender

## Question
rewards/ManualCompound.sol: the ISimpleHelper(_helperAddress).depositFor(receivedBalance, msg.sender) branch credits the full contract balance of that token to the caller in MasterMagpie. Under another user's multiclaimOnBehalf is pending in the mempool and will land in the same block, is there an unprivileged sequence of `compound(address[] _lps, address[][] _rewards, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, bool _lockMgp)` that leaves `_minRec supplied by the caller` unreconciled with `obtainedmWomAmount in SmartWomConvert`, violates the invariant that a deposit branch must credit only the caller's own earned amount, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/ManualCompound.sol -> `compound(address[] _lps, address[][] _rewards, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, bool _lockMgp)` (mechanism: helper branch deposits the whole balance for msg.sender)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `compound(address[] _lps, address[][] _rewards, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, bool _lockMgp)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: every element of _lps and _rewards, plus _convertRatio, _minRec and _lockMgp, with no restriction on who calls
- Exploit idea: the ISimpleHelper(_helperAddress).depositFor(receivedBalance, msg.sender) branch credits the full contract balance of that token to the caller in MasterMagpie. Precondition: another user's multiclaimOnBehalf is pending in the mempool and will land in the same block.
- Invariant to test: a deposit branch must credit only the caller's own earned amount; concretely, `_minRec supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `obtainedmWomAmount in SmartWomConvert`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `compound(address[] _lps, address[][] _rewards, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, bool _lockMgp)` sequence atomically under another user's multiclaimOnBehalf is pending in the mempool and will land in the same block, asserting at the end that `_minRec supplied by the caller` still equals `obtainedmWomAmount in SmartWomConvert` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
