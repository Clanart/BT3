# Q2402: BaseRewardPool.getRewards - duplicate reward tokens inside one getRewards array

## Question
In rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol, getRewards() iterates the caller's array with no uniqueness check, so the same reward token can be visited repeatedly within one settlement while userRewards and userRewardPerTokenPaid mutate between iterations. Starting from a state where the staking token is an 18-decimal Wombat receipt token and totalStaked() is far above 1e18, can an unprivileged EOA use `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` to leave `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` inconsistent with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`, violating the invariant that settling the same reward token twice in one call must be equivalent to settling it once and extracting High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: duplicate reward tokens inside one getRewards array)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec / multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: getRewards() iterates the caller's array with no uniqueness check, so the same reward token can be visited repeatedly within one settlement while userRewards and userRewardPerTokenPaid mutate between iterations. Precondition: the staking token is an 18-decimal Wombat receipt token and totalStaked() is far above 1e18.
- Invariant to test: settling the same reward token twice in one call must be equivalent to settling it once; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` sequence atomically under the staking token is an 18-decimal Wombat receipt token and totalStaked() is far above 1e18, asserting at the end that `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` still equals `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
