# Q3739: Break reimbursement recoverability in add_and_get_txids_from_block

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with crafted the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering so `add_and_get_txids_from_block` moves the protocol past the point where reimbursement should remain recoverable, leaving the reimbursement path that must remain slashable and recoverable inconsistent with the assumption that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, and leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/bitcoin_syncer.rs::add_and_get_txids_from_block
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering
- Exploit idea: move bridge state forward while reimbursement/slashability stays tied to older state
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
