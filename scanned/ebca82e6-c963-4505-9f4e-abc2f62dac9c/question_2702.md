# Q2702: Confuse confirmation/finalization tracking in create_fee_payer_utxo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit timing around the `cancel_outpoints` / `cancel_txids` dependency lists so `create_fee_payer_utxo` records a confirmation/finalization view that diverges from the actual chain state, corrupting the cancel/activate dependency graph persisted in the database and breaking the invariant that RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/cpfp.rs::create_fee_payer_utxo
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `cancel_outpoints` / `cancel_txids` dependency lists
- Exploit idea: diverge chain-observation state from persisted send state using the `cancel_outpoints` / `cancel_txids` dependency lists
- Invariant to test: RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
