# Q2133: mWOM.convert - mWOM minted on the requested amount rather than on veWOM actually obtained

## Question
wombat/mWOM.sol: _convert() mints exactly _amount of mWOM and then _lockWom() adds only the returned mintedVeWomAmount to totalAccumulated, so a veWOM mint that returns less than expected leaves mWOM supply ahead of real backing. With _amount, and the block relative to any pending convertAllWom under attacker control and wombatStaking is holding WOM from an earlier deposit that has not been locked, can an unprivileged caller sequence `convert(uint256 _amount)` so that `_amount minted as mWOM` and `mintedVeWomAmount returned by IWombatStaking.convertWOM` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that wrapper supply must never exceed the backing actually secured for it and realising Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWOM.sol -> `convert(uint256 _amount)` (mechanism: mWOM minted on the requested amount rather than on veWOM actually obtained)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `convert(uint256 _amount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, and the block relative to any pending convertAllWom
- Exploit idea: _convert() mints exactly _amount of mWOM and then _lockWom() adds only the returned mintedVeWomAmount to totalAccumulated, so a veWOM mint that returns less than expected leaves mWOM supply ahead of real backing. Precondition: wombatStaking is holding WOM from an earlier deposit that has not been locked.
- Invariant to test: wrapper supply must never exceed the backing actually secured for it; concretely, `_amount minted as mWOM` must stay reconciled with `mintedVeWomAmount returned by IWombatStaking.convertWOM`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish wombatStaking is holding WOM from an earlier deposit that has not been locked, have the attacker run `convert(uint256 _amount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_amount minted as mWOM` versus `mintedVeWomAmount returned by IWombatStaking.convertWOM` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
