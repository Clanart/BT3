# Q2603: accounts_db.add_root flush-path service pinning

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `add_root` by submit transactions that maximize write churn near root movement with heavy write churn near root movement so that a legal transaction/read pattern can force this path into a flush-heavy mode that blocks unrelated work, breaking the invariant that background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::add_root
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that maximize write churn near root movement
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn near root movement
- Exploit idea: treat flush pressure as the resource
- Invariant to test: background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: run churn-heavy writes plus immediate reads and measure latency inflation
