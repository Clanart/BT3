# Q585: Solana init_transfer origin and destination nonce desynchronization at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Solana `init_transfer` instruction` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer` violate `one outbound Solana transfer must consume exactly the asset and fee implied by the emitted message and must not let native-vault and bridged-burn branches diverge` in the `origin and destination nonce desynchronization` attack class because charges native fee into the SOL vault, either transfers native custody into the vault or burns bridged supply, and posts a Near-bound message becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `init_transfer` instruction`
- Attacker controls: mint, source token account, optional vault, user signer, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, and message
- Exploit idea: Drive retries, resume paths, or recursive bridge legs until one deposit appears under more than one transfer identity. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: one outbound Solana transfer must consume exactly the asset and fee implied by the emitted message and must not let native-vault and bridged-burn branches diverge
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trace every nonce mutation site and fuzz repeated calls plus reordered callbacks to prove that one deposit cannot create two valid transfer ids or destination messages. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
