# Q756: Misbind storage-proof semantics in collect_withdrawal_utxos

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings so `collect_withdrawal_utxos` treats one storage slot, value, or path as proving another, corrupting the storage slot/value pair used to prove deposit or withdrawal state and violating the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/citrea.rs::collect_withdrawal_utxos
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings
- Exploit idea: treat one storage slot/value/path as if it proved another using storage-proof nodes, slots, and value encodings
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
