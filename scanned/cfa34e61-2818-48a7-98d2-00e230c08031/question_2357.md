# Q2357: accounts_db.load premature frozen-slot assumption

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by submit transactions or make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that force repeated account lookups with high-churn account creation/close patterns, repeated reads, and same-pubkey updates across nearby slots so that this path can treat a slot as finalized for one purpose before all related account state is safely written, breaking the invariant that frozen-slot assumptions must not outpace actual durable state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::load
- Entrypoint: submit transactions or make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that force repeated account lookups
- Attacker controls: high-churn account creation/close patterns, repeated reads, and same-pubkey updates across nearby slots
- Exploit idea: search for early frozen assumptions
- Invariant to test: frozen-slot assumptions must not outpace actual durable state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace slot-freeze transitions and storage durability
