# Q5490: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.withdraw - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
In wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` while the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, and drive `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` out of agreement with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` - breaking the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value - for Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`: constrain the setup so that the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, fuzz the attacker inputs (_liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check), and assert after every call that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value.
