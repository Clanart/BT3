# Q340: NEAR init_transfer resume path origin and destination nonce desynchronization through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `yield-resume callback for a previously deferred outbound transfer` with control over timing of storage funding, promise completion order, storage owner, message-storage account state, and the original transfer message contents and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_resume` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `origin and destination nonce desynchronization` attack class because removes a stored promise id, retries storage transfer from the message account, and then restarts `init_transfer_internal` after a timeout or callback result, violating `resume logic must never let one deferred transfer be funded, resumed, or emitted more than once or under a different payer/value pairing`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_resume`
- Entrypoint: `yield-resume callback for a previously deferred outbound transfer`
- Attacker controls: timing of storage funding, promise completion order, storage owner, message-storage account state, and the original transfer message contents
- Exploit idea: Drive retries, resume paths, or recursive bridge legs until one deposit appears under more than one transfer identity. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: resume logic must never let one deferred transfer be funded, resumed, or emitted more than once or under a different payer/value pairing
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trace every nonce mutation site and fuzz repeated calls plus reordered callbacks to prove that one deposit cannot create two valid transfer ids or destination messages. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_resume` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
