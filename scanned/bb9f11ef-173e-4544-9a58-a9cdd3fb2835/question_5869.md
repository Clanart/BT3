# Q5869: validate_transactions_static_epoch_and_process_transaction: contract-call argument Value deserializes past its declared type

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `validate_transactions_static_epoch_and_process_transaction` (in `stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/transactions.rs`) via a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions), such that a payload arg Value violates its type and the callee trusts it, breaking the invariant that every arg Value == a Value of its declared type — leading to type confusion in the called contract?

## Target
- File/function: `stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/transactions.rs` -> `validate_transactions_static_epoch_and_process_transaction`
- Entrypoint: a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions)
- Attacker controls: the full auth structure (singlesig/multisig/order-independent/sponsored), nonce, fee, chain id, version, payload, and post-condition list, plus mutation of their own signed transactions
- Exploit idea: a payload arg Value violates its type and the callee trusts it
- Invariant to test: every arg Value == a Value of its declared type
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - type confusion in the called contract
- Fast validation: test an over-typed argument
