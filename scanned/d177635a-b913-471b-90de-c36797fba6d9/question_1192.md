# Q1192: verify_transaction_with_serialized_message duplicate signature split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `verify_transaction_with_serialized_message` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with versioned message features, duplicate accounts, precompiles, and boundary serialized forms such that one signature can correspond to meaningfully different downstream work because state tracked here keys off the wrong identity boundary, breaking the invariant that transaction identity used for dedup and status must match executed semantics and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::verify_transaction_with_serialized_message
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: versioned message features, duplicate accounts, precompiles, and boundary serialized forms
- Exploit idea: look for a mismatch between signature identity and executed write set or retry state
- Invariant to test: transaction identity used for dedup and status must match executed semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: replay semantically different but signature-colliding boundary cases
