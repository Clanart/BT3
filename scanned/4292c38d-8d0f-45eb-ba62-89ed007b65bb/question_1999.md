# Q1999: Confuse replacement linkage in load_deposit_state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` so `load_deposit_state` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the emergency-stop transaction that should protect the same deposit to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/builder/sighash.rs::load_deposit_state
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
