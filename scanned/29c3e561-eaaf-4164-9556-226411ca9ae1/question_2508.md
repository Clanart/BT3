# Q2508: Solana finalize_transfer emitter or factory binding mismatch at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Solana `finalize_transfer` instruction` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::finalize_transfer` violate `a signed inbound transfer must settle exactly once to one mint/recipient pair and must not switch between native-vault and bridged-mint branches` in the `emitter or factory binding mismatch` attack class because verifies the NEAR-derived signature, uses `UsedNonces::use_nonce`, then either transfers from the native vault or mints bridged supply and posts a completion message back to Near becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::finalize_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `finalize_transfer` instruction`
- Attacker controls: signed payload bytes, destination nonce, mint account, recipient account, vault existence, payer funding, and account ordering
- Exploit idea: Target derivation of emitter identity from token-address chain, VAA bytes, or factory maps. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: a signed inbound transfer must settle exactly once to one mint/recipient pair and must not switch between native-vault and bridged-mint branches
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Forge mismatched token-chain and emitter-chain combinations and assert that source authentication fails unless every binding agrees. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
