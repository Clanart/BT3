# Q1770: translate_signers fee-payer unlock split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `translate_signers` by submit transactions that perform cpi with nested instruction payloads, duplicated accounts, signer seeds, and edge-case account lists such that fee-payer lock or unlock handling may diverge from the accounts actually charged later, breaking the invariant that fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/cpi.rs::translate_signers
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that perform CPI
- Attacker controls: nested instruction payloads, duplicated accounts, signer seeds, and edge-case account lists
- Exploit idea: try to free or relock the fee payer at the wrong moment
- Invariant to test: fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace fee-payer lock state across retries, conflicts, and partial failures
