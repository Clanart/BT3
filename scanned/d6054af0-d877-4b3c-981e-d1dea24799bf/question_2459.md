# Q2459: get_pubkey_account_for_slot roots-to-flush backlog blowup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `get_pubkey_account_for_slot` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads while transactions keep rewriting one pubkey with same-pubkey rewrites across slots, immediate reads, and cached-versus-storage lookups so that attacker-driven write patterns can keep the pending-root backlog large enough to destabilize memory or latency, breaking the invariant that pending roots and flush backlog must stay bounded under valid user workload and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::get_pubkey_account_for_slot
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads while transactions keep rewriting one pubkey
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey rewrites across slots, immediate reads, and cached-versus-storage lookups
- Exploit idea: treat backlog growth as the exploit
- Invariant to test: pending roots and flush backlog must stay bounded under valid user workload
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: drive repeated write bursts across roots and monitor backlog size
