# Q5553: interest-rate via collateral-add: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling `amount`, drive `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) — which interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `collateral-add` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `interest-rate` touches, run `collateral-add` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
