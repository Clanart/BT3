# Q2452: get_pubkey_account_for_slot slot-cache latest drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `get_pubkey_account_for_slot` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads while transactions keep rewriting one pubkey with same-pubkey rewrites across slots, immediate reads, and cached-versus-storage lookups so that latest-account selection can choose the wrong slot under same-pubkey churn, breaking the invariant that latest-account resolution must pick the true latest visible slot and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::get_pubkey_account_for_slot
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads while transactions keep rewriting one pubkey
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey rewrites across slots, immediate reads, and cached-versus-storage lookups
- Exploit idea: target multiple nearby slot writes to one pubkey
- Invariant to test: latest-account resolution must pick the true latest visible slot
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: rewrite one account across nearby slots and verify which version low-rate reads observe
