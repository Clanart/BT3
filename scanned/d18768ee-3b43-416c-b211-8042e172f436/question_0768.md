# Q768: Misbind storage-proof semantics in citrea_batch_proof_method_id_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering so `citrea_batch_proof_method_id_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate` treats one storage slot, value, or path as proving another, corrupting the light-client proof context tied to a specific Bitcoin block and violating the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/tests.rs::citrea_batch_proof_method_id_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering
- Exploit idea: treat one storage slot/value/path as if it proved another using Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
