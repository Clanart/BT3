# Q1889: get-asset-value via liquidate-redeem: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) — which resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction — to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the redemption receiver, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
