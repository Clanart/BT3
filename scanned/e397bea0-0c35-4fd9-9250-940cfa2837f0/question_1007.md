# Q1007: call-liquidate via liquidate: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
`call-liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907) invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, use that to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, violating the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907` -> `call-liquidate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `call-liquidate` invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot. Reach it through `liquidate` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
