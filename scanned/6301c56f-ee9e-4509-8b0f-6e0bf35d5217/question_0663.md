# Q663: Misbind trusted context inside create_latest_blockhash_tx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `create_latest_blockhash_tx` through public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline and make attacker-controlled the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context bind to the wrong trusted context, so the operator signature set attached to a deposit is interpreted for one bridge action while authorizing another, violating the invariant that partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/builder/transaction/sign.rs::create_latest_blockhash_tx
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context
- Exploit idea: bind attacker-controlled the set of verifier, operator, or watchtower keys that get associated with the deposit context to the wrong trusted bridge context
- Invariant to test: partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
