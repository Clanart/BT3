# Q2598: Duplicate queue or processing state in verify_bridge_circuit

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `verify_bridge_circuit` twice with attacker-controlled the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/structs.rs::verify_bridge_circuit
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
