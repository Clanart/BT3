# Q1701: collect_sort_filter_ancient_slots widens instruction privileges (ancient_append_vecs.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `collect_sort_filter_ancient_slots` in `accounts-db/src/ancient_append_vecs.rs` with a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit, and make the stored account meta length disagree with the bytes actually readable from the append vec, so that the invariant "Callee privileges are always a subset of the caller's for the same account." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/ancient_append_vecs.rs` -> `collect_sort_filter_ancient_slots()` (around line 522)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: a maximal instruction/account count that pushes the path to its declared limit
- Exploit idea: Use `collect_sort_filter_ancient_slots` so the callee sees signer or writable privileges the caller never held, letting an attacker program act on a victim account.
- Invariant to test: Callee privileges are always a subset of the caller's for the same account.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Assert in a test that the callee's `is_signer`/`is_writable` for each account is implied by the parent instruction's.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy a program that reads or writes host/guest memory outside its permitted regions, or forges an account reference, and extracts or corrupts state belonging to other accounts.
