# Q2820: remove_slots_le write-cache ordering drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove_slots_le` by submit transactions that churn the same pubkeys across old and new slots with same-pubkey churn across slots plus cleanup pressure so that writeback ordering can make later readers observe a different account version than accounting code assumed, breaking the invariant that write-cache ordering must preserve one coherent latest-account view and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::remove_slots_le
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that churn the same pubkeys across old and new slots
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey churn across slots plus cleanup pressure
- Exploit idea: search for ordering-sensitive reads around flush/writeback boundaries
- Invariant to test: write-cache ordering must preserve one coherent latest-account view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace storage writes and immediate reads during slot/root churn
