# Q16: new spend mis-bind attacker-controlled bytes to trusted state via AGG SIG ME and AGG SIG UNSAFE condition mixes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker feed a malicious CLVM spend output into condition parsing targeting `new_spend` in `crates/chia-consensus/src/conditions.rs` with AGG_SIG_ME and AGG_SIG_UNSAFE condition mixes at a fork-height or boundary-value activation point make chia_rs mis-bind attacker-controlled bytes to trusted state, violating the invariant that duplicate or malformed conditions cannot relax timelocks or signatures, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: High. Signature, aggregate signature, synthetic key, puzzle type, condition, timelock, or coin-id validation bypass enables unauthorized spend acceptance or replay?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-consensus/src/conditions.rs:89` / `new_spend`
- Entrypoint: feed a malicious CLVM spend output into condition parsing
- Attacker controls: AGG_SIG_ME and AGG_SIG_UNSAFE condition mixes
- Exploit idea: Drive `new_spend` through its public caller path using AGG_SIG_ME and AGG_SIG_UNSAFE condition mixes; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: duplicate or malformed conditions cannot relax timelocks or signatures
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Signature, aggregate signature, synthetic key, puzzle type, condition, timelock, or coin-id validation bypass enables unauthorized spend acceptance or replay
- Fast validation: round-trip through py_validate_clvm_and_signature and Rust validation and compare results.
