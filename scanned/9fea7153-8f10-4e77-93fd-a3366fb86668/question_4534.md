# Q4534: mWOMSVBaseRewarder.getReward - forfeited value recycled to the same stakers who forfeited it

## Question
rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol: _sendReward() routes forfeitAmount into _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer(), which raises rewardPerTokenStored for everyone currently staked including the forfeiting account, so a dominant staker recovers most of their own forfeit. With the settlement timing, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim and through the locker's unlock path under attacker control and the victim has not settled for several epochs and holds a large userRewards balance, can an unprivileged caller sequence `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` so that `_calExpireForfeit(account,_amount)` and `mWOMSV.getRewardablePercentWAD(account)` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that value forfeited on exit must accrue to the users who remained committed, not back to the exiting account and realising High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: forfeited value recycled to the same stakers who forfeited it)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the settlement timing, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim and through the locker's unlock path
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() routes forfeitAmount into _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer(), which raises rewardPerTokenStored for everyone currently staked including the forfeiting account, so a dominant staker recovers most of their own forfeit. Precondition: the victim has not settled for several epochs and holds a large userRewards balance.
- Invariant to test: value forfeited on exit must accrue to the users who remained committed, not back to the exiting account; concretely, `_calExpireForfeit(account,_amount)` must stay reconciled with `mWOMSV.getRewardablePercentWAD(account)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the victim has not settled for several epochs and holds a large userRewards balance, snapshot `_calExpireForfeit(account,_amount)` and `mWOMSV.getRewardablePercentWAD(account)`, run the attacker's `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
