# Q3638: calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction confuses account types or owners (cost_model.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction` in `cost-model/src/cost_model.rs` with a nested structure with an attacker-chosen depth and element count, and have `calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `cost-model/src/cost_model.rs` -> `calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction()` (around line 203)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a nested structure with an attacker-chosen depth and element count
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `calculate_account_data_size_on_deserialized_system_instruction` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy a program that reads or writes host/guest memory outside its permitted regions, or forges an account reference, and extracts or corrupts state belonging to other accounts.
