# Q3454: calc-liquidation-params via liquidate: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liquidation-params` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739` -> `calc-liquidation-params`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper. Reach it through `liquidate` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
