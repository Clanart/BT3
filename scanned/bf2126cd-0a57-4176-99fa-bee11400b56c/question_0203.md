# Q203: NEAR storage_unregister storage quote underestimates live state via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public NEAR storage-management entrypoint` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::storage_unregister` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `storage quote underestimates live state` under attempts to unregister an account from bridge storage accounting, violating `unregister must never let an attacker sever the balance record that still backs unresolved bridge state or unlock more NEAR than was truly free`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::storage_unregister`
- Entrypoint: `public NEAR storage-management entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: force flag and timing relative to active pending/fast/finalized records
- Exploit idea: Target helper functions that quote storage for pending transfers, finalization records, fast transfers, binds, or deployments. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: unregister must never let an attacker sever the balance record that still backs unresolved bridge state or unlock more NEAR than was truly free
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Measure storage usage across maximal inputs and assert that quoted requirements always exceed or equal the true post-state footprint. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
