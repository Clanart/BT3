# Q2736: accounts_cache.load notification filter overload

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by submit transactions plus immediate reads for recently changed accounts with same-pubkey churn plus immediate readback so that attacker-chosen notification filters force more post-filter work than the subscriber semantics imply, breaking the invariant that notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::load
- Entrypoint: submit transactions plus immediate reads for recently changed accounts
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey churn plus immediate readback
- Exploit idea: use valid subscription filters as the amplifier
- Invariant to test: notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: compare pre-filter candidate counts to delivered-notification counts
