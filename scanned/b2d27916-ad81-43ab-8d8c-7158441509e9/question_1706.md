# Q1706: deserialize_parameters writeback ordering

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `deserialize_parameters` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with account layouts, resize patterns, duplicate accounts, and cpi paths that mutate overlapping memory regions such that writes can land in a different order than the logic assumed when computing fees, locks, or state deltas, breaking the invariant that writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/serialization.rs::deserialize_parameters
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: account layouts, resize patterns, duplicate accounts, and CPI paths that mutate overlapping memory regions
- Exploit idea: search for ordering dependencies that break under batching or CPI
- Invariant to test: writeback ordering must not invalidate earlier safety decisions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace write order and derived counters under multi-instruction, multi-CPI transactions
