# Q2703: accounts_cache.store flush-path service pinning

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store` by submit transactions that update many accounts in one slot with many writable accounts, repeated same-pubkey writes, and slot-boundary churn so that a legal transaction/read pattern can force this path into a flush-heavy mode that blocks unrelated work, breaking the invariant that background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::store
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that update many accounts in one slot
- Attacker controls: many writable accounts, repeated same-pubkey writes, and slot-boundary churn
- Exploit idea: treat flush pressure as the resource
- Invariant to test: background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: run churn-heavy writes plus immediate reads and measure latency inflation
