# Q2612: accounts_db.add_root notification context drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `add_root` by submit transactions that maximize write churn near root movement with heavy write churn near root movement so that watcher or filter state can pair payloads with the wrong slot/root context, breaking the invariant that notification payloads and context must describe the same event/state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::add_root
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that maximize write churn near root movement
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn near root movement
- Exploit idea: look for impossible payload/context combinations
- Invariant to test: notification payloads and context must describe the same event/state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: cross-check delivered notifications against direct state at the same reported slot/root
