# Q4783: MasterMagpie.massUpdatePools - lpSupply inflation by direct token donation

## Question
In rewards/MasterMagpie.sol, _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Does `massUpdatePools()` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the pool's rewarder is a V2 rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol that caches stakingTokenDecimals at construction, so that `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].rewardDebt` diverges from `tokenToPoolInfo[_stakingToken].accMGPPerShare`, the invariant that MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply is broken, and the result is High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `massUpdatePools()` (mechanism: lpSupply inflation by direct token donation)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `massUpdatePools()`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the block in which every registered pool is rolled forward at once
- Exploit idea: _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Precondition: the pool's rewarder is a V2 rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol that caches stakingTokenDecimals at construction.
- Invariant to test: MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply; concretely, `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].rewardDebt` must stay reconciled with `tokenToPoolInfo[_stakingToken].accMGPPerShare`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (the block in which every registered pool is rolled forward at once) under the pool's rewarder is a V2 rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol that caches stakingTokenDecimals at construction, asserting on every row that MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply.
