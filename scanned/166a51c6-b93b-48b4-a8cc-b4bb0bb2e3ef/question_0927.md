# Q927: to clvm skip a required validation guard via curried program argument trees

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker hash curried CLVM programs targeting `to_clvm` in `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs` with curried program argument trees when serialized bytes are validly framed but semantically adversarial make chia_rs skip a required validation guard, violating the invariant that CLVM atom encodings have canonical typed meanings, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs:191` / `to_clvm`
- Entrypoint: hash curried CLVM programs
- Attacker controls: curried program argument trees
- Exploit idea: Drive `to_clvm` through its public caller path using curried program argument trees; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: CLVM atom encodings have canonical typed meanings
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data
- Fast validation: round-trip ToClvm/FromClvm and compare tree hashes.
