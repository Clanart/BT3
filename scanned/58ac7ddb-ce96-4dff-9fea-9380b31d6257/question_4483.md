# Q4483: get-bitmap via borrow: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`get-bitmap` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145) returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the future mask produced by the new debt bit, use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145` -> `get-bitmap`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `get-bitmap` returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Reach it through `borrow` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, then read `get-bitmap` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
