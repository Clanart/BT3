# Q2288: system-borrow via repay: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal reach `system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:865) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it independently computes `scaled-amount` with `mul-div-up` from its own `index`, duplicating the market's own scaling of the same borrow, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:865` -> `system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `system-borrow` independently computes `scaled-amount` with `mul-div-up` from its own `index`, duplicating the market's own scaling of the same borrow. Reach it through `repay` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal varied, and assert that the value `system-borrow` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
