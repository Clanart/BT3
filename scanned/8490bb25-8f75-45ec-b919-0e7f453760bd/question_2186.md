# Q2186: Exploit reorg boundary handling in citrea_reveal_rbf_bumpfee_increases_feerate_and_mines

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit reorg timing around replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions so `citrea_reveal_rbf_bumpfee_increases_feerate_and_mines` treats a non-canonical object as canonical long enough to mutate bridge state, corrupting the storage slot/value pair used to prove deposit or withdrawal state and violating the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/tests.rs::citrea_reveal_rbf_bumpfee_increases_feerate_and_mines
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions
- Exploit idea: reorder or replay replacement-deposit linkage between Citrea state and Bitcoin move transactions across canonical and non-canonical views
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
