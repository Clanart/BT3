# Q3149: filter_signature_result cleanup drops live state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_signature_result` by use in-scope signature subscriptions and many status changes with signature subscription parameters and hot status churn so that cleanup or compaction can discard still-live attacker-controlled account state, breaking the invariant that live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_signature_result
- Entrypoint: use in-scope signature subscriptions and many status changes
- Attacker controls: signature subscription parameters and hot status churn
- Exploit idea: look for mistaken liveness decisions under fast churn
- Invariant to test: live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn many attacker-owned accounts through close/recreate/update cycles
