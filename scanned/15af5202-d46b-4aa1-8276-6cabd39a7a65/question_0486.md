# Q486: NEAR public transfer-message reads origin and destination nonce desynchronization through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public off-chain coordination reads for pending transfers` with control over transfer id choice and timing relative to sign/claim/finalize callbacks and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::get_transfer_message / get_transfer_message_storage` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `origin and destination nonce desynchronization` attack class because returns stored pending-transfer records that off-chain actors use to build signatures, fees, and proofs, violating `publicly-observable pending state must remain canonical so external actors cannot be induced to sign or relay the wrong transfer`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::get_transfer_message / get_transfer_message_storage`
- Entrypoint: `public off-chain coordination reads for pending transfers`
- Attacker controls: transfer id choice and timing relative to sign/claim/finalize callbacks
- Exploit idea: Drive retries, resume paths, or recursive bridge legs until one deposit appears under more than one transfer identity. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: publicly-observable pending state must remain canonical so external actors cannot be induced to sign or relay the wrong transfer
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trace every nonce mutation site and fuzz repeated calls plus reordered callbacks to prove that one deposit cannot create two valid transfer ids or destination messages. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::get_transfer_message / get_transfer_message_storage` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
