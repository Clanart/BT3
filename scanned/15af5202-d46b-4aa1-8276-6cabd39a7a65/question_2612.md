# Q2612: NEAR process_fin_transfer_to_near storage-preparation omission changes settlement meaning

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker make `internal path reached from public `fin_transfer`` omit or reorder required storage setup so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::process_fin_transfer_to_near` settles under a different assumption about who can receive principal or fees because of marks the transfer finalised, optionally redirects payout to the fast-transfer relayer, checks storage-deposit actions for recipient and fee recipients, unlocks tokens, sends tokens, and mints fee tokens in the callback, violating `Near-side finalization must never misroute recipient funds, fee funds, or lock state across storage setup, fast-transfer substitution, and callback resolution`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::process_fin_transfer_to_near`
- Entrypoint: `internal path reached from public `fin_transfer``
- Attacker controls: recipient account, predecessor account, transfer message, storage-deposit actions, fast-transfer status, and lock actions
- Exploit idea: Target recipient or fee-recipient storage checks that gate token delivery or fee minting.
- Invariant to test: Near-side finalization must never misroute recipient funds, fee funds, or lock state across storage setup, fast-transfer substitution, and callback resolution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Reorder or omit storage-deposit actions and assert that settlement either fully aborts before finalization or completes with all intended recipients properly provisioned.
