# Q4393: get-notional-evaluation via borrow: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the future mask produced by the new debt bit, drive `get-notional-evaluation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514) — which folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total — to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514` -> `get-notional-evaluation`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total. Reach it through `borrow` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, then read `get-notional-evaluation` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
