# Q1181: NEAR UTXO transfer dispatcher recipient or fee-recipient rebinding at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger ``ft_on_transfer` branch for UTXO-origin settlement` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::utxo_fin_transfer` violate `UTXO-origin flows must not let one origin outpoint or replacement message fan out into multiple bridge settlements or mismatched lock states` in the `recipient or fee-recipient rebinding` attack class because routes UTXO-origin settlements into Near or other-chain legs, creates fast-transfer state when applicable, and tracks `UnifiedTransferId` rather than plain nonces becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::utxo_fin_transfer`
- Entrypoint: ``ft_on_transfer` branch for UTXO-origin settlement`
- Attacker controls: token id, amount, signer/sender split, UTXO transfer message, origin chain, relayer fee, recipient, and message
- Exploit idea: Exploit optional fee-recipient fields, fast-transfer relayer substitution, or predecessor-captured identities. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: UTXO-origin flows must not let one origin outpoint or replacement message fan out into multiple bridge settlements or mismatched lock states
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Build pairs of proofs/messages that vary only in recipient-oriented fields and assert that settlement, fee claim, and event emission stay bound to one tuple. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
