# Q3881: mWOM.incentiveDeposit - mWOM minted on the requested amount rather than on veWOM actually obtained

## Question
In wombat/mWOM.sol, _convert() mints exactly _amount of mWOM and then _lockWom() adds only the returned mintedVeWomAmount to totalAccumulated, so a veWOM mint that returns less than expected leaves mWOM supply ahead of real backing. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, bool _stake)` while helper is set to a SimplePoolHelper and the attacker uses convertAndStake, and drive `_amount minted as mWOM` out of agreement with `mintedVeWomAmount returned by IWombatStaking.convertWOM` - breaking the invariant that wrapper supply must never exceed the backing actually secured for it - for Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWOM.sol -> `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, bool _stake)` (mechanism: mWOM minted on the requested amount rather than on veWOM actually obtained)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, bool _stake)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount with no cap, and _stake, while rewardRatio is non-zero
- Exploit idea: _convert() mints exactly _amount of mWOM and then _lockWom() adds only the returned mintedVeWomAmount to totalAccumulated, so a veWOM mint that returns less than expected leaves mWOM supply ahead of real backing. Precondition: helper is set to a SimplePoolHelper and the attacker uses convertAndStake.
- Invariant to test: wrapper supply must never exceed the backing actually secured for it; concretely, `_amount minted as mWOM` must stay reconciled with `mintedVeWomAmount returned by IWombatStaking.convertWOM`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount with no cap, and _stake, while rewardRatio is non-zero) under helper is set to a SimplePoolHelper and the attacker uses convertAndStake, asserting on every row that wrapper supply must never exceed the backing actually secured for it.
