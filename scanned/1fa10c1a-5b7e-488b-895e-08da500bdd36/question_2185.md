# Q2185: handle_forwarded_packets account resurrection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `handle_forwarded_packets` by submit transactions that legitimately enter the forwarding path with payload sizes, duplicate packets, versioned messages, and boundary forwarding timing such that a zero-lamport or closed account can be revived or reused incorrectly, breaking the invariant that closed or zero-lamport accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/fetch_stage.rs::handle_forwarded_packets
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that legitimately enter the forwarding path
- Attacker controls: payload sizes, duplicate packets, versioned messages, and boundary forwarding timing
- Exploit idea: look for stale cache or store ordering that makes dead accounts look live again
- Invariant to test: closed or zero-lamport accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: close and recreate the same account shape repeatedly and diff live/dead visibility
