# Q5563: add-user-scaled-debt via liquidate: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
`add-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237) adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, use that to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237` -> `add-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, then read `add-user-scaled-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
