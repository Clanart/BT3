# Q3786: SmartWomConvert.convertFor - safeApprove without reset on the mWOM mint leg

## Question
In wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol, _convertFor() calls IERC20(wom).safeApprove(mWom, convertAmount) with no reset before IMWom(mWom).deposit, so residue there disables conversion entirely. Starting from a state where the call arrives from ArbWomUp3._deposit mode two with _minRec hardcoded to zero, can an unprivileged EOA use `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)` to leave `_minRec` inconsistent with `convertAmount + amountRec`, violating the invariant that the mint leg must remain usable regardless of allowance residue and extracting High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol -> `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset on the mWOM mint leg)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _for, _convertRatio, _minRec and _mode, reachable directly and through ManualCompound.compound
- Exploit idea: _convertFor() calls IERC20(wom).safeApprove(mWom, convertAmount) with no reset before IMWom(mWom).deposit, so residue there disables conversion entirely. Precondition: the call arrives from ArbWomUp3._deposit mode two with _minRec hardcoded to zero.
- Invariant to test: the mint leg must remain usable regardless of allowance residue; concretely, `_minRec` must stay reconciled with `convertAmount + amountRec`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the call arrives from ArbWomUp3._deposit mode two with _minRec hardcoded to zero, have the attacker run `convertFor(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _convertRatio, uint256 _minRec, address _for, uint256 _mode)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_minRec` versus `convertAmount + amountRec` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
