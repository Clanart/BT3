# Q5182: convert-to-assets-preview via deposit: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling `min-out`, can an unprivileged attacker make `convert-to-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317` -> `convert-to-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Reach it through `deposit` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with `min-out`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
