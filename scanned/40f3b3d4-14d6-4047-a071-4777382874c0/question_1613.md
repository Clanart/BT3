# Q1613: NEAR promise bookkeeping resume-path replay or duplication via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public yield-resume flow through deferred outbound transfers` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::add_promise/remove_promise/init_transfer_promises` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `resume-path replay or duplication` under tracks deferred init-transfer promises by account id so they can resume once storage arrives, violating `promise bookkeeping must never let an attacker orphan, overwrite, or resume someone else’s pending outbound transfer`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::add_promise/remove_promise/init_transfer_promises`
- Entrypoint: `public yield-resume flow through deferred outbound transfers`
- Attacker controls: message-storage account id, yielded promise id, repeated funding, and callback timing
- Exploit idea: Abuse yield/resume or asynchronous callback timing so the same pending outbound transfer is restarted after it already progressed. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: promise bookkeeping must never let an attacker orphan, overwrite, or resume someone else’s pending outbound transfer
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trigger timeouts, duplicate funding, and repeated callback delivery and assert that the resumed transfer either progresses once or cleanly fails once. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
