# Q5149: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.deposit - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol - WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _amount and _minimumLiquidity, under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, exploit this through `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` to break the reconciliation between `pid cached at construction` and `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` and the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding, yielding High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity) under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, asserting on every row that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding.
