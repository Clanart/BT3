# Q2118: find-and-resolve-asset-value via collateral-remove-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, can an unprivileged attacker make `find-and-resolve-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `find-and-resolve-asset-value` reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668` -> `find-and-resolve-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `find-and-resolve-asset-value` reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `find-and-resolve-asset-value` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
