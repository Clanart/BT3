# Q3703: mWOMSVBaseRewarder.getRewards - totalStaked and balanceOf drawn from unrelated sources

## Question
In rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol, totalStaked() reads IERC20(mWOMSV).totalSupply() while balanceOf() reads MasterMagpie's UserInfo.amount for the same account, so the numerator and the denominator of every reward computation come from two independently maintained ledgers. Does `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under totalStaked is zero and queuedRewards holds a backlog, so that `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` diverges from `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored`, the invariant that sum of balanceOf over all accounts must equal totalStaked at all times is broken, and the result is Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/mWOMSVBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: totalStaked and balanceOf drawn from unrelated sources)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: totalStaked() reads IERC20(mWOMSV).totalSupply() while balanceOf() reads MasterMagpie's UserInfo.amount for the same account, so the numerator and the denominator of every reward computation come from two independently maintained ledgers. Precondition: totalStaked is zero and queuedRewards holds a backlog.
- Invariant to test: sum of balanceOf over all accounts must equal totalStaked at all times; concretely, `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` must stay reconciled with `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` sequence atomically under totalStaked is zero and queuedRewards holds a backlog, asserting at the end that `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` still equals `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
