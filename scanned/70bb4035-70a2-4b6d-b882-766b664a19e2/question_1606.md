# Q1606: ArbWomUp3.incentiveDeposit - the locked amount is taken from the whole contract balance

## Question
Consider wombat/ArbWomUp3.sol, where _deposit() mode 2 reads mWomBal = IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this)) after the convert and locks that entire balance for _account, so any mWOM stranded on the contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to this caller. Assuming the caller sets _convertRatio to zero so the whole leg is swapped, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `bracketRewarded` and `calDoubledCounted(account)` via `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _convertRatio, bool _bullMode, uint256 _mode)`, breaking the invariant that a caller must only be credited with the value their own transaction produced and producing Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/ArbWomUp3.sol -> `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _convertRatio, bool _bullMode, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: the locked amount is taken from the whole contract balance)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _convertRatio, bool _bullMode, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, _convertRatio, _bullMode and _mode, with _mode selecting stake, mWomSV lock or plain transfer
- Exploit idea: _deposit() mode 2 reads mWomBal = IERC20(mWom).balanceOf(address(this)) after the convert and locks that entire balance for _account, so any mWOM stranded on the contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to this caller. Precondition: the caller sets _convertRatio to zero so the whole leg is swapped.
- Invariant to test: a caller must only be credited with the value their own transaction produced; concretely, `bracketRewarded` must stay reconciled with `calDoubledCounted(account)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _convertRatio, bool _bullMode, uint256 _mode)` sequence atomically under the caller sets _convertRatio to zero so the whole leg is swapped, asserting at the end that `bracketRewarded` still equals `calDoubledCounted(account)` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
