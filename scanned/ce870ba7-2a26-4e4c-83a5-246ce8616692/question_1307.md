# Q1307: Exploit replacement logic in set_cancel_txid_seen_at_height

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the `signed_tx_hex` payload so `set_cancel_txid_seen_at_height` constructs a replacement path that copies the wrong witnesses, inputs, or fee logic, corrupting the binding between raw transaction bytes and the queued tx-sender metadata and violating the invariant that RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent, leading to Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/db/tx_sender.rs::set_cancel_txid_seen_at_height
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Exploit idea: copy the wrong witnesses, inputs, or fee logic by shaping the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Invariant to test: RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
