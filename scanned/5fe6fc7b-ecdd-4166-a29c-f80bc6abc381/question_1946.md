# Q1946: EVM custom-minter bridge path native versus wrapped branch switch at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public `initTransfer` and `finTransfer` when `customMinters[token] != 0`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol customMinters branches` violate `custom-minter branches must not let a token escape custody or mint semantics that the bridge assumes for replay protection and accounting` in the `native versus wrapped branch switch` attack class because delegates burn and mint semantics to an external custom minter instead of standard bridge-token logic becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol customMinters branches`
- Entrypoint: `public `initTransfer` and `finTransfer` when `customMinters[token] != 0``
- Attacker controls: token address, custom-minter registration state, amount, and recipient
- Exploit idea: Target zero-address, deployed-token, custom-minter, native-vault, or bridge-token branch predicates. Concentrate on zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values.
- Invariant to test: custom-minter branches must not let a token escape custody or mint semantics that the bridge assumes for replay protection and accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each branch predicate to flip around callbacks or mapping writes and assert that the same source asset can never produce two incompatible custody models. Sweep boundary values for zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
