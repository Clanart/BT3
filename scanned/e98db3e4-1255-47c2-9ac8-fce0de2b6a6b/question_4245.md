# Q4245: BaseRewardPoolV2.updateFor - stake, claim and unstake inside one block

## Question
Consider rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol, where balanceOf() is an instantaneous read of MasterMagpie's UserInfo.amount with no time weighting, so an attacker can deposit, trigger updateFor/getReward and withdraw inside a single transaction to capture an index jump they contributed nothing to. Assuming a previously registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` and `userRewardPerTokenPaid[_rewardToken][account]` via `updateFor(address _account)`, breaking the invariant that reward share must be weighted by time held, not by balance at the instant the index moves and producing Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol -> `updateFor(address _account)` (mechanism: stake, claim and unstake inside one block)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `updateFor(address _account)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted
- Exploit idea: balanceOf() is an instantaneous read of MasterMagpie's UserInfo.amount with no time weighting, so an attacker can deposit, trigger updateFor/getReward and withdraw inside a single transaction to capture an index jump they contributed nothing to. Precondition: a previously registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer.
- Invariant to test: reward share must be weighted by time held, not by balance at the instant the index moves; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` must stay reconciled with `userRewardPerTokenPaid[_rewardToken][account]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish a previously registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer, have the attacker run `updateFor(address _account)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` versus `userRewardPerTokenPaid[_rewardToken][account]` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
