# Q3555: Drive state split inside work_only_from_header_chain_test

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation with crafted the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values so `work_only_from_header_chain_test` updates one canonical value while another subsystem retains the older one for the same event, corrupting the storage-proof key/value binding used for deposit or withdrawal validation and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/bridge_circuit_host.rs::work_only_from_header_chain_test
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Exploit idea: update one canonical value while another subsystem keeps the old one for the same event via the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
