# Q2195: EVM BridgeToken mint custody accounting diverges from wrapped supply via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public settlement-side mint reachable only through bridge-owner calls` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/BridgeToken.sol::mint` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `custody accounting diverges from wrapped supply` under owner-only mint can either mint directly or mint with a message-enabled variant consumed by the bridge settlement flow, violating `mint-with-message and plain mint must not differ in a way that lets an attacker keep minted value while also forcing a settlement rollback or duplicate release`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/BridgeToken.sol::mint`
- Entrypoint: `public settlement-side mint reachable only through bridge-owner calls`
- Attacker controls: beneficiary, amount, optional message bytes, and the receiver’s callback behavior when message-based minting is used
- Exploit idea: Target branches that mint, burn, lock, unlock, transfer vault assets, or unwrap native value. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: mint-with-message and plain mint must not differ in a way that lets an attacker keep minted value while also forcing a settlement rollback or duplicate release
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Build a per-asset conservation model and assert that total claims never exceed total backing after every public flow. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
