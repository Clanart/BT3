# Q1045: commit_transactions account resurrection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `commit_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transactions that partially fail, write many accounts, resize data, and alter fees or rent state such that a zero-lamport or closed account can be revived or reused incorrectly, breaking the invariant that closed or zero-lamport accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::commit_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transactions that partially fail, write many accounts, resize data, and alter fees or rent state
- Exploit idea: look for stale cache or store ordering that makes dead accounts look live again
- Invariant to test: closed or zero-lamport accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: close and recreate the same account shape repeatedly and diff live/dead visibility
