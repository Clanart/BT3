# Q5536: convert-to-assets-preview via accrue: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update reach `convert-to-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317) in a state where it satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? Given that it prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317` -> `convert-to-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Reach it through `accrue` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
