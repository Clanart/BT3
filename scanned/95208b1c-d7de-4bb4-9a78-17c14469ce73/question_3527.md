# Q3527: oracle-timestamp-fresh via supply-collateral-add: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
`oracle-timestamp-fresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:365) sets `delta` to u0 whenever `ts` exceeds `stacks-block-time`, so a future timestamp is maximally fresh, then requires `(>= ts prev)`. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, use that to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:365` -> `oracle-timestamp-fresh`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `oracle-timestamp-fresh` sets `delta` to u0 whenever `ts` exceeds `stacks-block-time`, so a future timestamp is maximally fresh, then requires `(>= ts prev)`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
