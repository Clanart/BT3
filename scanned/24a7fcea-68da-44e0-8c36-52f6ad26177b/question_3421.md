# Q3421: NEAR storage account-id calculation storage withdrawal escapes live liabilities via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public outbound transfers that allow `external_id`` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::calculate_storage_account_id and init-transfer callers` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `storage withdrawal escapes live liabilities` under derives a per-transfer storage account id that can be pre-funded and later used to resume deferred transfers, violating `storage account ids must be collision-resistant across attacker-controlled `external_id` choices so one user cannot fund or resume another user’s transfer`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::calculate_storage_account_id and init-transfer callers`
- Entrypoint: `public outbound transfers that allow `external_id``
- Attacker controls: `external_id`, sender, recipient, token, origin nonce, and any fields used to derive the message-storage account id
- Exploit idea: Look for withdrawals and unregister paths that do not fully account for pending, finalized, or fast-transfer records. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: storage account ids must be collision-resistant across attacker-controlled `external_id` choices so one user cannot fund or resume another user’s transfer
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Open live bridge state, withdraw aggressively, and assert that storage balances cannot fall below the reserved amount implied by that live state. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
