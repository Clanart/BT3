# Q3934: Struct mis-bind attacker-controlled bytes to trusted state via big integer encodings

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker decode attacker-controlled CLVM targeting `Struct` in `crates/clvm-traits/src/lib.rs` with big integer encodings when equivalent-looking encodings are mixed make chia_rs mis-bind attacker-controlled bytes to trusted state, violating the invariant that list terminators cannot change parsed conditions, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: High. Signature, aggregate signature, synthetic key, puzzle type, condition, timelock, or coin-id validation bypass enables unauthorized spend acceptance or replay?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-traits/src/lib.rs:177` / `Struct`
- Entrypoint: decode attacker-controlled CLVM
- Attacker controls: big integer encodings
- Exploit idea: Drive `Struct` through its public caller path using big integer encodings; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: list terminators cannot change parsed conditions
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Signature, aggregate signature, synthetic key, puzzle type, condition, timelock, or coin-id validation bypass enables unauthorized spend acceptance or replay
- Fast validation: fuzz CLVM atoms and lists and assert typed decoding matches clvmr semantics.
