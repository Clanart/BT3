# Q4760: BaseRewardPool.updateFor - early-continue skips a genuine balance change

## Question
Consider rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol, where the userRewardPerTokenPaid == rewardPerToken early-continue treats an unchanged global index as proof that nothing is owed, but balanceOf(account) is read live from MasterMagpie, so a balance that changed while the index stood still is never folded into userRewards. Assuming a previously registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` and `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` via `updateFor(address _account)`, breaking the invariant that userRewards must capture every balance-weighted segment, including segments where the global index did not move and producing High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol -> `updateFor(address _account)` (mechanism: early-continue skips a genuine balance change)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `updateFor(address _account)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted
- Exploit idea: the userRewardPerTokenPaid == rewardPerToken early-continue treats an unchanged global index as proof that nothing is owed, but balanceOf(account) is read live from MasterMagpie, so a balance that changed while the index stood still is never folded into userRewards. Precondition: a previously registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer.
- Invariant to test: userRewards must capture every balance-weighted segment, including segments where the global index did not move; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted) under a previously registered reward token has begun reverting on transfer, asserting on every row that userRewards must capture every balance-weighted segment, including segments where the global index did not move.
