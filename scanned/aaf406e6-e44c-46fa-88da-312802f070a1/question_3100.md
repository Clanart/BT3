# Q3100: mWomSV.cancelUnlock - mWomSV has no forceUnLock so value can only leave through the full cooldown

## Question
wombat/mWomSV.sol: unlike VLMGP, wombat/mWomSV.sol exposes no forceUnLock path, so a slot whose accounting becomes inconsistent has no penalty-bearing escape hatch and the mWOM behind it cannot be recovered. Under the attacker holds a second address so lockFor can be used across two accounts, is there an unprivileged sequence of `cancelUnlock(uint256 _slotIndex)` that leaves `userUnlockings[user][i].amountInCoolDown` unreconciled with `maxSlot`, violates the invariant that every locked position must retain at least one reachable exit path under all reachable states, and delivers Critical - Permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWomSV.sol -> `cancelUnlock(uint256 _slotIndex)` (mechanism: mWomSV has no forceUnLock so value can only leave through the full cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `cancelUnlock(uint256 _slotIndex)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _slotIndex and the moment the cooldown is aborted
- Exploit idea: unlike VLMGP, wombat/mWomSV.sol exposes no forceUnLock path, so a slot whose accounting becomes inconsistent has no penalty-bearing escape hatch and the mWOM behind it cannot be recovered. Precondition: the attacker holds a second address so lockFor can be used across two accounts.
- Invariant to test: every locked position must retain at least one reachable exit path under all reachable states; concretely, `userUnlockings[user][i].amountInCoolDown` must stay reconciled with `maxSlot`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `cancelUnlock(uint256 _slotIndex)` sequence atomically under the attacker holds a second address so lockFor can be used across two accounts, asserting at the end that `userUnlockings[user][i].amountInCoolDown` still equals `maxSlot` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
