# Q0171: WombatBribeManager.vote - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, where because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Assuming a large bribe has just landed in the Wombat bribe contract and no cast has happened yet, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `earnedRewards reported by claimAllBribes` and `the tokens actually transferred by getReward` via `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)`, breaking the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates and producing Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: a large bribe has just landed in the Wombat bribe contract and no cast has happened yet.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `earnedRewards reported by claimAllBribes` must stay reconciled with `the tokens actually transferred by getReward`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under a large bribe has just landed in the Wombat bribe contract and no cast has happened yet, then assert `earnedRewards reported by claimAllBribes` and `the tokens actually transferred by getReward` end identical in both runs.
