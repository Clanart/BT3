# Q2155: Substitute a wrong proof path into deserialize_txin

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker substitute part of attacker-controlled reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height so `deserialize_txin` accepts a proof, header, or path that should have been rejected, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/transaction.rs::deserialize_txin
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: swap part of attacker-controlled reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height while keeping the rest seemingly valid
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
