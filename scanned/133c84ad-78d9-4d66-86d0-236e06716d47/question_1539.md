# Q1539: SmartWomConvert.smartConvert - shared mWOM balance is settled to whoever calls next

## Question
wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol: mode 1 and mode 2 approve and forward obtainedmWomAmount out of the contract's own balance rather than out of a per-user ledger, so mWOM stranded in this contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to the next caller. With _amountIn and _mode, plus the pool state that currentRatio and maxSwapAmount are read from under attacker control and the attacker has pushed mWom above the peg so currentRatio exceeds buybackThreshold and no swap leg runs, can an unprivileged caller sequence `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` so that `amountRec from swapExactTokensForTokens` and `convertAmount minted 1:1 by IMWom(mWom).deposit` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that one caller must never be settled out of value another caller left behind and realising Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/SmartWomConvert.sol -> `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: shared mWOM balance is settled to whoever calls next)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountIn and _mode, plus the pool state that currentRatio and maxSwapAmount are read from
- Exploit idea: mode 1 and mode 2 approve and forward obtainedmWomAmount out of the contract's own balance rather than out of a per-user ledger, so mWOM stranded in this contract by an earlier rounding or partial fill is handed to the next caller. Precondition: the attacker has pushed mWom above the peg so currentRatio exceeds buybackThreshold and no swap leg runs.
- Invariant to test: one caller must never be settled out of value another caller left behind; concretely, `amountRec from swapExactTokensForTokens` must stay reconciled with `convertAmount minted 1:1 by IMWom(mWom).deposit`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `smartConvert(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _mode)` sequence atomically under the attacker has pushed mWom above the peg so currentRatio exceeds buybackThreshold and no swap leg runs, asserting at the end that `amountRec from swapExactTokensForTokens` still equals `convertAmount minted 1:1 by IMWom(mWom).deposit` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
