# Q1500: NEAR sign_transfer recipient or message ambiguity via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `sign_transfer` on a pending transfer id` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::sign_transfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `recipient or message ambiguity` under loads a stored transfer, normalizes the amount using destination token decimals, parses destination message, and asks MPC to sign a `TransferMessagePayload` for the destination chain, violating `every stored transfer must hash to one unambiguous outbound payload with one fee model, one token mapping, and one recipient intent`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::sign_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public `sign_transfer` on a pending transfer id`
- Attacker controls: transfer id, optional fee recipient, optional fee override, attached deposit, and any stored transfer fields reachable through the chosen id
- Exploit idea: Exploit non-canonical string, ByteArray, hex, or account-id forms to make one source-side intent resolve to a different destination-side recipient or message. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: every stored transfer must hash to one unambiguous outbound payload with one fee model, one token mapping, and one recipient intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Cross-check source-side serialization against every downstream parser and assert that equivalent-looking inputs cannot resolve to distinct destination accounts or app messages. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
