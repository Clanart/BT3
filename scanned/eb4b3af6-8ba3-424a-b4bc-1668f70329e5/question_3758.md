# Q3758: resolve-or-create via liquidate: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `liquidate` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted varied, and assert that the value `resolve-or-create` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
