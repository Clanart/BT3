# Q0376: special_stx_burn: fee/size rate miscomputed by a cast

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `special_stx_burn` (in `clarity/src/vm/functions/assets.rs`) via a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions), such that `fee / tx_size` under-counts due to a size mismatch between decoded and re-encoded tx, breaking the invariant that the size a tx is judged by == its canonical serialized size — leading to fee-floor bypass?

## Target
- File/function: `clarity/src/vm/functions/assets.rs` -> `special_stx_burn`
- Entrypoint: a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions)
- Attacker controls: the full auth structure (singlesig/multisig/order-independent/sponsored), nonce, fee, chain id, version, payload, and post-condition list, plus mutation of their own signed transactions
- Exploit idea: `fee / tx_size` under-counts due to a size mismatch between decoded and re-encoded tx
- Invariant to test: the size a tx is judged by == its canonical serialized size
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - fee-floor bypass
- Fast validation: test a tx whose decode/encode sizes differ
