# Q2953: notify_signatures_received flush-path service pinning

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_signatures_received` by subscribe to signatures and then submit many status-changing transactions with signature subscriptions, duplicate-signature churn, and slow consumer behavior so that a legal transaction/read pattern can force this path into a flush-heavy mode that blocks unrelated work, breaking the invariant that background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_signatures_received
- Entrypoint: subscribe to signatures and then submit many status-changing transactions
- Attacker controls: signature subscriptions, duplicate-signature churn, and slow consumer behavior
- Exploit idea: treat flush pressure as the resource
- Invariant to test: background flush work should not let one attacker pattern monopolize service resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: run churn-heavy writes plus immediate reads and measure latency inflation
