# Q2452: accrue-and-cache via repay: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal reach `accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `repay` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
