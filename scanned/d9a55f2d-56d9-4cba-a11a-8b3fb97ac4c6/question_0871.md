# Q871: NEAR storage_withdraw storage withdrawal escapes live liabilities via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public NEAR storage-management entrypoint` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::storage_withdraw` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `storage withdrawal escapes live liabilities` under subtracts from stored storage balance and transfers NEAR back to the caller, violating `withdrawals must not let users pull out storage still required for pending, finalised, or fast-transfer records that underpin live funds`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/storage.rs::storage_withdraw`
- Entrypoint: `public NEAR storage-management entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: withdraw amount, caller account, and timing relative to pending transfer lifecycle
- Exploit idea: Look for withdrawals and unregister paths that do not fully account for pending, finalized, or fast-transfer records. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: withdrawals must not let users pull out storage still required for pending, finalised, or fast-transfer records that underpin live funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Open live bridge state, withdraw aggressively, and assert that storage balances cannot fall below the reserved amount implied by that live state. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
