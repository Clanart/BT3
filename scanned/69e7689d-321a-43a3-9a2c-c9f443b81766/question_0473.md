# Q473: Misbind trusted context inside verify_and_save_emergency_stop_sigs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `verify_and_save_emergency_stop_sigs` through public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline and make attacker-controlled the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` bind to the wrong trusted context, so the deposit-to-move-tx binding is interpreted for one bridge action while authorizing another, violating the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/rpc/aggregator.rs::verify_and_save_emergency_stop_sigs
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: bind attacker-controlled the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` to the wrong trusted bridge context
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
