# Q2976: oracle-price-legal via liquidate-multi: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch reach `oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band, the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `oracle-price-legal` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
