# Q231: EVM OmniBridge logMetadata malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public EVM metadata logging entrypoint` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::logMetadata` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity` under reads metadata from an arbitrary ERC-20-like token, passes it to `logMetadataExtension`, and emits a `LogMetadata` event, violating `metadata logging must not let malicious token contracts create bridge-side asset identities or deployment proofs that can later mint or map the wrong asset`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol::logMetadata`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM metadata logging entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: token contract address, token-reported `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, and msg.value for extensions
- Exploit idea: Exploit arbitrary token metadata calls, old/new ABI switching, or malformed strings in metadata proofs. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: metadata logging must not let malicious token contracts create bridge-side asset identities or deployment proofs that can later mint or map the wrong asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Publish or prove pathological metadata values and assert that downstream deployment and mapping logic still binds to the right remote asset and decimals. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
