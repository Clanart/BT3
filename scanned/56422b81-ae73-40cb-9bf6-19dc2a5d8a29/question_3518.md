# Q3518: Solana FinalizeTransfer::process shared proof response reused across entrypoints through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public inbound flow through `finalize_transfer`` with control over destination nonce, mint/vault branch choice, recipient account, signed payload, and payer-funded account creation and desynchronize `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/finalize_transfer.rs::process` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `shared proof response reused across entrypoints` attack class because marks the nonce as used, either transfers native custody from the vault or mints bridged supply, then posts a finalize message back toward Near, violating `inbound settlement must not let the same signed payload mint and release native custody under different account layouts or branch assumptions`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/finalize_transfer.rs::process`
- Entrypoint: `public inbound flow through `finalize_transfer``
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, mint/vault branch choice, recipient account, signed payload, and payer-funded account creation
- Exploit idea: Attack systems where one verifier contract serves deploy, finalize, metadata, and fee-claim flows with a shared result type. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: inbound settlement must not let the same signed payload mint and release native custody under different account layouts or branch assumptions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Attempt to route accepted verifier outputs into every public proof consumer and assert that each entrypoint only accepts its intended result variant and source semantics. Also assert cross-module consistency between `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/finalize_transfer.rs::process` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
