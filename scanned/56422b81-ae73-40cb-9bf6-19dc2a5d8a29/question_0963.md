# Q963: NEAR normalized amount helpers recipient or fee-recipient rebinding via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public sign/finalize/claim paths across heterogeneous decimals` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::normalize_amount/denormalize_amount` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `recipient or fee-recipient rebinding` under normalizes and denormalizes bridge amounts when crossing chains with different decimals and later uses those values for settlement and fee claim, violating `amount conversions must never misprice a user’s principal or fee by more than the documented dust behavior or let attackers move the rounding remainder to the wrong party`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::normalize_amount/denormalize_amount`
- Entrypoint: `public sign/finalize/claim paths across heterogeneous decimals`
- Attacker controls: amount, fee, token decimals, origin decimals, destination decimals, and zero-fee versus nonzero-fee branches
- Exploit idea: Exploit optional fee-recipient fields, fast-transfer relayer substitution, or predecessor-captured identities. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: amount conversions must never misprice a user’s principal or fee by more than the documented dust behavior or let attackers move the rounding remainder to the wrong party
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Build pairs of proofs/messages that vary only in recipient-oriented fields and assert that settlement, fee claim, and event emission stay bound to one tuple. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
