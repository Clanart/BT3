# Q870: resanitize_transaction_minimally fee-payer unlock split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `resanitize_transaction_minimally` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction`, `simulatetransaction`, or direct tpu quic with versioned messages, address lookup tables, duplicated accounts, and boundary serialization forms such that fee-payer lock or unlock handling may diverge from the accounts actually charged later, breaking the invariant that fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::resanitize_transaction_minimally
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction`, `simulateTransaction`, or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, address lookup tables, duplicated accounts, and boundary serialization forms
- Exploit idea: try to free or relock the fee payer at the wrong moment
- Invariant to test: fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace fee-payer lock state across retries, conflicts, and partial failures
