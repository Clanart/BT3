# Q2734: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Does `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, so that `pid cached at construction` diverges from `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding is broken, and the result is High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, snapshot `pid cached at construction` and `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, run the attacker's `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
