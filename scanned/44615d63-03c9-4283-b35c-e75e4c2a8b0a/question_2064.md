# Q2064: MultiEvmHooks.PostTxProcessing - Hook Order Changes Final Bank Balances

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call a malicious contract from an unprivileged EOA through `configured EVM post-processing hooks` while controlling `contract creation flag` and `post-hook result`, under the precondition that a contract performs nested CALL/CREATE and reverts one frame, drive `ApplyTransaction -> ApplyMessageWithConfig -> PostTxProcessing -> RefundGas -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas` in `x/evm/keeper/hooks.go::MultiEvmHooks.PostTxProcessing` so that hook order changes final bank balances, violating the invariant that simulation and committed execution must only differ by persistence, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/hooks.go::MultiEvmHooks.PostTxProcessing`
- Entrypoint: `configured EVM post-processing hooks`
- Attacker controls: `contract creation flag`, `post-hook result`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: hook order changes final bank balances through `ApplyTransaction -> ApplyMessageWithConfig -> PostTxProcessing -> RefundGas -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas`.
- Invariant to test: simulation and committed execution must only differ by persistence.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: force the edge value at uint64/uint256/sdk.Int boundaries and assert no smaller debit, larger refund, or supply change occurs.
