# Q0310: vault-system-borrow via liquidate-multi: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), can an unprivileged attacker make `vault-system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198` -> `vault-system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
