# Q70: execute_l1_handler_transaction transaction-hash binding gap in execution/transaction_impls.cairo (nested-call revert edge)

## Question
Can a malicious L1-to-L2 message sender controlling the message payload and timing use transaction calldata, nonce selection, resource bounds and tip, signature material accepted by the sender's own account contract, message payloads, message ordering to make `execute_l1_handler_transaction` in `crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/transaction_impls.cairo` hash an attacker-controlled transaction under one field layout while the rest of the OS authorizes or executes a materially different layout around account nonce and replay protection, so that honest StarkNet OS execution commits, emits, or accepts an attacker-favorable result that reaches direct loss of funds? Can the discrepancy be triggered only after a nested call, constructor call, or inner revert changes ownership of side effects?

## Target
- File/function: crates/apollo_starknet_os_program/src/cairo/starkware/starknet/core/os/execution/transaction_impls.cairo:374 :: execute_l1_handler_transaction
- Entrypoint: malicious L1-to-L2 message sender controlling the message payload and timing
- Attacker controls: transaction calldata, nonce selection, resource bounds and tip, signature material accepted by the sender's own account contract, message payloads, message ordering
- Exploit idea: cause a transaction hash to omit, reorder, or differently encode a field that later affects execution, deployment, or fee behavior while this function is handling account nonce and replay protection. Drive the bug only after nested execution crosses a caller/callee or revert boundary.
- Invariant to test: every executed transaction effect must be bound to a unique hash over the exact fields that execution, validation, fee charging, and message handling consume Nested execution and rollback must preserve the same ownership and rollback invariant as the flat path.
- Expected bounty impact: Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: fuzz field lengths, resource-bounds packing, account-deployment data, and proof-facts attachment through this function, then assert no two materially different transactions share an accepted hash Construct a nested-call test with mixed success/failure outcomes and assert state, messages, and class changes stay attributable and revertable.
