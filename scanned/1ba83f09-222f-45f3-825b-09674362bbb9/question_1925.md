# Q1925: NEAR EVM eNear interface path asset-branch confusion on finalization at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `legacy/public eNEAR mint/burn/finalize flows` with boundary-controlled inputs covering zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and make `evm/src/eNear/contracts/IENear.sol and ENearProxy usage` violate `legacy adapter flows must not let stale eNEAR semantics bypass current replay protection or asset-backing assumptions` in the `asset-branch confusion on finalization` attack class because legacy proxy routes proof-validated Near outcomes into an older eNEAR mint/burn interface that still interacts with live bridge state becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/eNear/contracts/IENear.sol and ENearProxy usage`
- Entrypoint: `legacy/public eNEAR mint/burn/finalize flows`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, receipt ids, token address, amount, and pause state
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches. Concentrate on zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values.
- Invariant to test: legacy adapter flows must not let stale eNEAR semantics bypass current replay protection or asset-backing assumptions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state. Sweep boundary values for zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
