# Q860: NEAR finish_withdraw_v2 burn or lock before irreversible state via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `legacy/public withdrawal completion path on migrated tokens` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::finish_withdraw_v2` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `burn or lock before irreversible state` under accepts calls only from deployed-token contracts, allocates new origin and destination nonces, stores an outbound transfer, and logs an `InitTransfer` event to Ethereum, violating `legacy withdrawal completion must not let unprivileged callers mint outbound bridge claims without a corresponding inbound burn or with a misbound recipient`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::finish_withdraw_v2`
- Entrypoint: `legacy/public withdrawal completion path on migrated tokens`
- Attacker controls: sender id, bridged token contract calling in, amount, and recipient string parsed as Ethereum address
- Exploit idea: Look for branches where custody changes happen before the final pending-state, mapping, or callback outcome is fixed. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: legacy withdrawal completion must not let unprivileged callers mint outbound bridge claims without a corresponding inbound burn or with a misbound recipient
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Model failures between custody changes and state writes, then assert that no branch both consumes user value and allows the transfer to be replayed or dropped. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
