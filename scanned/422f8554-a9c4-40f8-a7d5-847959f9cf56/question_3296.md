# Q3296: combined_ema can be driven into unbounded work (program_metrics.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `combined_ema` in `program-runtime/src/program_metrics.rs` with arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied, and make `combined_ema` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `combined_ema` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/program_metrics.rs` -> `combined_ema()` (around line 224)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `combined_ema` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `combined_ema` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `combined_ema` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft bytecode, ELF metadata, precompile data, or zk proof input that panics, aborts, infinite-loops, or exhausts memory inside the VM and halts every validator.
