# Q764: prepare_entry_batch program-cache staleness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `prepare_entry_batch` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transaction ordering, duplicated accounts, address lookup tables, and batched conflicting write sets such that upgrade, close, or deploy timing makes this function observe a stale executor or stale deployment slot state, breaking the invariant that program cache contents must match loader-visible deployment state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::prepare_entry_batch
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transaction ordering, duplicated accounts, address lookup tables, and batched conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: look for old-code/new-state or new-code/old-state combinations
- Invariant to test: program cache contents must match loader-visible deployment state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race loader upgrades or closes against repeated invocations
