# Q5323: WombatPoolHelperV2.depositNative - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. With msg.value and _minimumLiquidity under attacker control and the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, can an unprivileged caller sequence `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` so that `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value and realising Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`: constrain the setup so that the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, fuzz the attacker inputs (msg.value and _minimumLiquidity), and assert after every call that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value.
