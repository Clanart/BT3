# Q5894: MasterMagpie.multiclaimFor - referral trigger fired on attacker-chosen victims

## Question
In rewards/MasterMagpie.sol, _multiClaim() ends with IReferralStorage(referral).trigger(_user, totalReward) and multiclaimFor lets the attacker pick _user, so referral accrual can be driven for arbitrary accounts at arbitrary times without their consent. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `multiclaimFor(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens, address _account)` while the victim is mid-cooldown in VLMGP so getRewardablePercentWAD is still 1e18, and drive `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].amount` out of agreement with `_calLpSupply(_stakingToken)` - breaking the invariant that referral accrual must be a consequence of the referee's own voluntary claim, not of a third party's transaction - for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `multiclaimFor(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens, address _account)` (mechanism: referral trigger fired on attacker-chosen victims)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `multiclaimFor(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens, address _account)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _account (any victim), the staking-token list and the per-pool reward-token lists
- Exploit idea: _multiClaim() ends with IReferralStorage(referral).trigger(_user, totalReward) and multiclaimFor lets the attacker pick _user, so referral accrual can be driven for arbitrary accounts at arbitrary times without their consent. Precondition: the victim is mid-cooldown in VLMGP so getRewardablePercentWAD is still 1e18.
- Invariant to test: referral accrual must be a consequence of the referee's own voluntary claim, not of a third party's transaction; concretely, `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].amount` must stay reconciled with `_calLpSupply(_stakingToken)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `multiclaimFor(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens, address _account)` sequence atomically under the victim is mid-cooldown in VLMGP so getRewardablePercentWAD is still 1e18, asserting at the end that `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].amount` still equals `_calLpSupply(_stakingToken)` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
