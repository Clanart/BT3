# Q5797: WombatBribeManager.vote - castVotes writes lastCastTime before the external voter call

## Question
In wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, lastCastTime is assigned before wombatStaking.vote executes, so the recorded cadence advances even for a cast whose downstream effects revert or are re-entered. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` while the victim has a large unsettled balance in the pool rewarder, and drive `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]` out of agreement with `IBribeRewardPool(pool.rewarder).balanceOf(user)` - breaking the invariant that a cadence marker must only advance once the operation it marks has completed - for Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` (mechanism: castVotes writes lastCastTime before the external voter call)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries
- Exploit idea: lastCastTime is assigned before wombatStaking.vote executes, so the recorded cadence advances even for a cast whose downstream effects revert or are re-entered. Precondition: the victim has a large unsettled balance in the pool rewarder.
- Invariant to test: a cadence marker must only advance once the operation it marks has completed; concretely, `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]` must stay reconciled with `IBribeRewardPool(pool.rewarder).balanceOf(user)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)`: constrain the setup so that the victim has a large unsettled balance in the pool rewarder, fuzz the attacker inputs (every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries), and assert after every call that a cadence marker must only advance once the operation it marks has completed.
