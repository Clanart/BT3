# Q5406: WombatPoolHelper.depositNative - receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, is there an unprivileged sequence of `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` that leaves `pid cached at construction` unreconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, violates the invariant that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Precondition: the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction.
- Invariant to test: the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the attacker deposits and withdraws through the helper inside one transaction, then assert `pid cached at construction` and `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` end identical in both runs.
