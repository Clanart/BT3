# Q669: Solana init response serialization origin and destination nonce desynchronization at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public init instructions through `InitTransfer::process` and `InitTransferSol::process`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/init_transfer.rs` violate `payload bytes must not let one Solana transfer be verified as another due to optional-string, nonce, or mint-field ambiguity` in the `origin and destination nonce desynchronization` attack class because serializes outbound transfer payloads that Near-side verifiers later accept as source-chain events becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/message/init_transfer.rs`
- Entrypoint: `public init instructions through `InitTransfer::process` and `InitTransferSol::process``
- Attacker controls: sender, mint, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, sequence, and origin nonce source
- Exploit idea: Drive retries, resume paths, or recursive bridge legs until one deposit appears under more than one transfer identity. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: payload bytes must not let one Solana transfer be verified as another due to optional-string, nonce, or mint-field ambiguity
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trace every nonce mutation site and fuzz repeated calls plus reordered callbacks to prove that one deposit cannot create two valid transfer ids or destination messages. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
