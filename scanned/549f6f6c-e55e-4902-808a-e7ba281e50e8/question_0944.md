# Q944: load_and_execute_transactions program-cache staleness

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_and_execute_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with versioned messages, alt-heavy account sets, cpi depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets such that upgrade, close, or deploy timing makes this function observe a stale executor or stale deployment slot state, breaking the invariant that program cache contents must match loader-visible deployment state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::load_and_execute_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, ALT-heavy account sets, CPI depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: look for old-code/new-state or new-code/old-state combinations
- Invariant to test: program cache contents must match loader-visible deployment state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race loader upgrades or closes against repeated invocations
