# Q2550: modify_accounts load/store torn read

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `modify_accounts` by submit transactions that update many related accounts in one bank with many writable accounts, cpi-heavy writes, and same-pubkey alias churn so that one caller can read a mix of pre-update and post-update fields because load and store paths disagree on version boundaries, breaking the invariant that one account read must resolve to one coherent version of that account and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::modify_accounts
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that update many related accounts in one bank
- Attacker controls: many writable accounts, CPI-heavy writes, and same-pubkey alias churn
- Exploit idea: seek field-level incoherence, not just old-vs-new whole values
- Invariant to test: one account read must resolve to one coherent version of that account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: diff lamports, data length, owner, and payload fields returned by immediate read-after-write patterns
