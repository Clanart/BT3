# Q3517: mask-to-list-internal via borrow: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, drive `mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) — which expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `borrow` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, then read `mask-to-list-internal` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
