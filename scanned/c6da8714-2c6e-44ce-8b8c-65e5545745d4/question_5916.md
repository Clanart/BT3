# Q5916: increment via transfer: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation reach `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it advances the user-id nonce, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `transfer` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation across its boundary values through `transfer` in simnet and assert `increment` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
