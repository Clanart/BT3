# Q3057: interpolate-rate via deposit: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, drive `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) — which interpolates between packed u16 curve points — to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `deposit` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `interpolate-rate` touches, run `deposit` with whether the vault is at a zero-supply or zero-asset edge, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
