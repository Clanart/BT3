# Q56: NEAR OmniToken mint asset-branch confusion on finalization

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public bridge-token mint path via controller-only callback reached from bridge delivery` to make `near/omni-token/src/lib.rs::mint` release value through a more favorable branch than the source event actually authorized because of controller-only mint either deposits directly or first credits the predecessor account then calls `ft_transfer_call` to the recipient when `msg` is present, violating `mint-with-message and plain mint must be economically equivalent and must not create balances on the controller or recipient that survive inconsistent callback outcomes`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-token/src/lib.rs::mint`
- Entrypoint: `public bridge-token mint path via controller-only callback reached from bridge delivery`
- Attacker controls: recipient account, amount, optional `msg`, and any receiver behavior in `ft_transfer_call`
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches.
- Invariant to test: mint-with-message and plain mint must be economically equivalent and must not create balances on the controller or recipient that survive inconsistent callback outcomes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state.
