# Q3071: NEAR Wormhole InitTransfer conversion emitter or factory binding mismatch at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Wormhole init-transfer proof flow` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/parsed_vaa.rs::TryInto<InitTransferMessage>` violate `decoded fields and derived source identity must stay bound to the intended source chain so a payload cannot be replayed across chain/address domains` in the `emitter or factory binding mismatch` attack class because Borsh-decodes a Wormhole payload into `InitTransferMessage` and derives the emitter address using `token_address.get_chain()` plus the VAA emitter bytes becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/parsed_vaa.rs::TryInto<InitTransferMessage>`
- Entrypoint: `public Wormhole init-transfer proof flow`
- Attacker controls: payload bytes inside a validated VAA, recipient string, token address chain, sender address, fee fields, and message
- Exploit idea: Target derivation of emitter identity from token-address chain, VAA bytes, or factory maps. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: decoded fields and derived source identity must stay bound to the intended source chain so a payload cannot be replayed across chain/address domains
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Forge mismatched token-chain and emitter-chain combinations and assert that source authentication fails unless every binding agrees. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
