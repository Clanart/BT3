# Q1813: total-debt via deposit: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, drive `total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) — which computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index` — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `deposit` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `deposit` with the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, then read `total-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
