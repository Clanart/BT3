# Q3630: Claimed-Flag Ordering Bug By Reusing Data Cross Module

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `pallet_ismp_relayer::claim_outbound_consensus_delivery_reward(origin=None, claim)` with attacker-controlled withdrawal proofs, destination proofs, payee bytes, signatures, claim destinations, and replay ordering and reusing data that should belong to one chain, module, order, state machine, or payee in another publicly reachable path, and make `process_outbound_consensus_delivery_claim` credit fees or rewards before the one-time claimed marker is unambiguously locked so `the claimed state that prevents duplicate payouts` becomes inconsistent with `the first successful accumulation or reward claim only`, breaking the invariant that claimed markers must move atomically with the payout so a revert or partial state update cannot reopen the same reward path and leading to High: duplicate settlement, duplicate claim, or double execution of a one-time flow?

## Target
- File/function: modules/pallets/relayer/src/outbound_consensus.rs::process_outbound_consensus_delivery_claim
- Entrypoint: pallet_ismp_relayer::claim_outbound_consensus_delivery_reward(origin=None, claim)
- Attacker controls: withdrawal proofs, destination proofs, payee bytes, signatures, claim destinations, and replay ordering
- Exploit idea: Credit fees or rewards before the one-time claimed marker is unambiguously locked. Craft two public flows that share one byte string or hash and check whether module, chain, or payee binding is enforced everywhere.
- Invariant to test: claimed markers must move atomically with the payout so a revert or partial state update cannot reopen the same reward path
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: duplicate settlement, duplicate claim, or double execution of a one-time flow.
- Fast validation: Force a failing transfer or failing downstream check after a partial state mutation, then retry and assert the reward or fee cannot be collected twice. Feed the same bytes through two reachable entrypoints and assert the second path rejects instead of inheriting the first path's authorization.
