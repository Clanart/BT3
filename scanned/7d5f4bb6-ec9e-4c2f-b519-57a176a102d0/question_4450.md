# Q4450: WombatBribeManager.vote - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. With every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries under attacker control and delegatedPool is unset so the delegate legs are skipped, can an unprivileged caller sequence `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` so that `targetVote computed in castVotes` and `totalVotes() from veWom.balanceOf(wombatStaking)` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates and realising Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: delegatedPool is unset so the delegate legs are skipped.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `targetVote computed in castVotes` must stay reconciled with `totalVotes() from veWom.balanceOf(wombatStaking)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under delegatedPool is unset so the delegate legs are skipped, then assert `targetVote computed in castVotes` and `totalVotes() from veWom.balanceOf(wombatStaking)` end identical in both runs.
