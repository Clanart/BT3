# Q3524: set_locale: A `locale` object that is not a string so `.to_sym`/`.split` mi...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `locale` param and `session[:locale]`) reach `set_locale` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/localization.rb via any localized controller action with a `locale` param, supplying a `locale` object that is not a string so `.to_sym`/`.split` misbehaves, so that locale selection must be constrained to available locales and never influence file/template resolution is violated, leading to unexpected template/render behavior from attacker locale (only if it yields real impact)? Specifically confirm that the crafted request is rejected or scoped to the attacker's own shop.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/localization.rb — `set_locale`
- Entrypoint: any localized controller action with a `locale` param
- Attacker controls: the `locale` param and `session[:locale]` — specifically a `locale` object that is not a string so `.to_sym`/`.split` misbehaves.
- Exploit idea: Craft the single HTTP request above against a default app install and confirm the boundary holds.
- Invariant to test: locale selection must be constrained to available locales and never influence file/template resolution
- Expected Immunefi impact: unexpected template/render behavior from attacker locale (only if it yields real impact) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: controller/request spec issuing the crafted request and asserting a 401/redirect-to-own-origin, not access.
