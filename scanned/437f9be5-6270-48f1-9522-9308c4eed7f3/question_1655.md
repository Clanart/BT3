# Q1655: serialize_parameters sanitize-execute split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `serialize_parameters` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with account layouts, resize patterns, duplicate accounts, and cpi paths that mutate overlapping memory regions such that a versioned message shape survives early checks but is interpreted differently when this function consumes it, breaking the invariant that the transaction semantics accepted for processing must match the semantics later executed and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/serialization.rs::serialize_parameters
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: account layouts, resize patterns, duplicate accounts, and CPI paths that mutate overlapping memory regions
- Exploit idea: use legal message encodings to find a semantic mismatch between validation and execution
- Invariant to test: the transaction semantics accepted for processing must match the semantics later executed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: diff the sanitized message, loaded accounts, and executed instruction stream
