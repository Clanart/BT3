# Q668: voteSubscribe downstream queue coupling

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `voteSubscribe` within the single-client low-rate model and choose subscription parameters, pubkeys/signatures/filters, encoding choices, websocket disconnect timing, and one slow or bursty client such that `vote_subscribe` triggers a path where one request here triggers enough downstream work to inflate unrelated queues or watchers, violating the invariant that one request should not explode unrelated internal work queues and causing `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_pubsub.rs::vote_subscribe
- Entrypoint: WebSocket `voteSubscribe` from a single client connection
- Attacker controls: subscription parameters, pubkeys/signatures/filters, encoding choices, websocket disconnect timing, and one slow or bursty client
- Exploit idea: trace the queues behind the API, not just the immediate method body
- Invariant to test: one request should not explode unrelated internal work queues
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: instrument downstream queue lengths while replaying one heavy call shape
