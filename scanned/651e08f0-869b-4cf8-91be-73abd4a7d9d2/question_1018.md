# Q1018: Race queue_txs_for_challenged_kickoff across concurrent state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker batch, retry, or reorder public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline interactions around the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit` so `queue_txs_for_challenged_kickoff` observes inconsistent state across memory, database, and on-chain checks, breaking the invariant that partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind, and leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/verifier.rs::queue_txs_for_challenged_kickoff
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: use retries, batching, or timing around the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit` to desynchronize state
- Invariant to test: partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
