# Q3109: filter_block_result_txs roots-to-flush backlog blowup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_block_result_txs` by use in-scope block subscriptions and hot block contents with block subscription filters, detail levels, and hot block streams so that attacker-driven write patterns can keep the pending-root backlog large enough to destabilize memory or latency, breaking the invariant that pending roots and flush backlog must stay bounded under valid user workload and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_block_result_txs
- Entrypoint: use in-scope block subscriptions and hot block contents
- Attacker controls: block subscription filters, detail levels, and hot block streams
- Exploit idea: treat backlog growth as the exploit
- Invariant to test: pending roots and flush backlog must stay bounded under valid user workload
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: drive repeated write bursts across roots and monitor backlog size
