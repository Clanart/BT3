# Q3424: update_access_scopes?: A nil stored scope compared against configured scopes yielding ...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `shop` domain param selecting the stored session to compare) reach `update_access_scopes?` in lib/shopify_app/access_scopes/shop_strategy.rb via legacy scope-change reauth (ShopAccessScopesVerification), supplying a nil stored scope compared against configured scopes yielding a false 'no change', so that scope-change detection must key on the verified shop, not an arbitrary param is violated, leading to scope reauthorization bypass? Specifically confirm that merchant A can never load, write, or act with merchant B's session, token, or scopes.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/access_scopes/shop_strategy.rb — `update_access_scopes?`
- Entrypoint: legacy scope-change reauth (ShopAccessScopesVerification)
- Attacker controls: the `shop` domain param selecting the stored session to compare — specifically a nil stored scope compared against configured scopes yielding a false 'no change'.
- Exploit idea: Perform the flow as merchant A while naming shop/user B and confirm no B-scoped data is reachable.
- Invariant to test: scope-change detection must key on the verified shop, not an arbitrary param
- Expected Immunefi impact: scope reauthorization bypass (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: two-tenant integration test asserting A's request never loads, writes, or acts with B's session/token.
