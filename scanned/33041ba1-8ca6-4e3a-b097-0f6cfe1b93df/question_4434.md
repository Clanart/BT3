# Q4434: WombatPoolHelper.depositLP - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Does `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, so that `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` diverges from `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`, the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard is broken, and the result is Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, have the attacker run `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` versus `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
