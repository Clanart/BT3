# Q3254: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getRewards - forfeited value recycled to the same stakers who forfeited it

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, _sendReward() routes forfeitAmount into _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer(), which raises rewardPerTokenStored for everyone currently staked including the forfeiting account, so a dominant staker recovers most of their own forfeit. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` while the attacker holds a dominant share of totalStaked so the forfeit recycles mostly back to them, and drive `totalStaked()` out of agreement with `IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply()` - breaking the invariant that value forfeited on exit must accrue to the users who remained committed, not back to the exiting account - for High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: forfeited value recycled to the same stakers who forfeited it)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() routes forfeitAmount into _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer(), which raises rewardPerTokenStored for everyone currently staked including the forfeiting account, so a dominant staker recovers most of their own forfeit. Precondition: the attacker holds a dominant share of totalStaked so the forfeit recycles mostly back to them.
- Invariant to test: value forfeited on exit must accrue to the users who remained committed, not back to the exiting account; concretely, `totalStaked()` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply()`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the attacker holds a dominant share of totalStaked so the forfeit recycles mostly back to them, have the attacker run `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `totalStaked()` versus `IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply()` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
