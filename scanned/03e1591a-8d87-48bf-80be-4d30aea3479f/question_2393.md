# Q2393: NEAR omitted storage-check result helper final settlement and later fee claim can diverge through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public finalize and fast-transfer callbacks after storage payment checks` with control over storage action count, callback result size, and chosen index for recipient/fee-recipient checks and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::check_storage_balance_result and callback consumers` from the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `final settlement and later fee claim can diverge` attack class because interprets callback results from storage-balance checks to decide whether recipient and fee-recipient storage exists, violating `callback-result interpretation must not let a missing or reordered storage check masquerade as success and push settlement into an underprepared recipient account`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::check_storage_balance_result and callback consumers`
- Entrypoint: `public finalize and fast-transfer callbacks after storage payment checks`
- Attacker controls: storage action count, callback result size, and chosen index for recipient/fee-recipient checks
- Exploit idea: Target differences between settle-time denormalization and claim-time recomputation of fee, dust, or relayer substitution. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: callback-result interpretation must not let a missing or reordered storage check masquerade as success and push settlement into an underprepared recipient account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Compare settled principal, stored transfer record, and fee-claim proof under edge amounts and assert that the three always reconstruct one consistent event. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::check_storage_balance_result and callback consumers` and the adjacent storage billing and refund bookkeeping after every branch.
