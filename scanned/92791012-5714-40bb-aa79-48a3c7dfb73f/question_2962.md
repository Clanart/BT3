# Q2962: notify_signatures_received notification context drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_signatures_received` by subscribe to signatures and then submit many status-changing transactions with signature subscriptions, duplicate-signature churn, and slow consumer behavior so that watcher or filter state can pair payloads with the wrong slot/root context, breaking the invariant that notification payloads and context must describe the same event/state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_signatures_received
- Entrypoint: subscribe to signatures and then submit many status-changing transactions
- Attacker controls: signature subscriptions, duplicate-signature churn, and slow consumer behavior
- Exploit idea: look for impossible payload/context combinations
- Invariant to test: notification payloads and context must describe the same event/state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: cross-check delivered notifications against direct state at the same reported slot/root
