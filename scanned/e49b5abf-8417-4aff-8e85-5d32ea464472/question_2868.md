# Q2868: EVM Wormhole nonce progression remote publication drifts from local deployment state via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public init/deploy/log/finalize flows on Wormhole-backed chains` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::wormholeNonce usage across extensions` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `remote publication drifts from local deployment state` under reuses one incrementing `wormholeNonce` across deploy, metadata, init, and finalize message publication, violating `Wormhole nonce progression must stay synchronized with actual published messages so a failed publish cannot be replayed or gap-filled by another message class`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::wormholeNonce usage across extensions`
- Entrypoint: `public init/deploy/log/finalize flows on Wormhole-backed chains`
- Attacker controls: message publication ordering, msg.value, and any extension reentrancy or failure mode
- Exploit idea: Focus on message publication before/after nonce increments, mapping writes, or external deploy steps. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: Wormhole nonce progression must stay synchronized with actual published messages so a failed publish cannot be replayed or gap-filled by another message class
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fail each external step independently and assert that every published message corresponds to exactly one deployed and bindable local token. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
