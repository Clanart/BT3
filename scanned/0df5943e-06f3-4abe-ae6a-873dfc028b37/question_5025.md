# Q5025: status-multi via collateral-remove: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, drive `status-multi` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:163) — which calls `(map unwrap-status ids mask)` as a TWO-LIST map where `mask` is `uint-to-list-u64` of the bitmap, pairing each id positionally and truncating to the shorter list — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:163` -> `status-multi`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `status-multi` calls `(map unwrap-status ids mask)` as a TWO-LIST map where `mask` is `uint-to-list-u64` of the bitmap, pairing each id positionally and truncating to the shorter list. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `status-multi` touches, run `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
