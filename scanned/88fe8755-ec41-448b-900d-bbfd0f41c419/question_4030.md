# Q4030: calc-index-next via borrow: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `borrow` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
