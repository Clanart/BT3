# Q3953: zip via liquidate-multi: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) — which pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element — to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the full batch list and its ordering, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
