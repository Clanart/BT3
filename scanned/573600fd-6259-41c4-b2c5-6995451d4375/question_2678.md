# Q2678: calc-liq-debt-repay-real via liquidate-multi: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling the trait principals supplied per entry, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:733) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` re-derives debt from capped collateral by dividing by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:733` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay-real`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` re-derives debt from capped collateral by dividing by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with the trait principals supplied per entry varied, and assert that the value `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
