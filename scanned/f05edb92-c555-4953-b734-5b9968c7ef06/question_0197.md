# Q0197: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` while the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, and drive `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` out of agreement with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` - breaking the invariant that a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value - for Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: pid, lpToken and stakingToken are fixed at construction and never revalidated)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: the helper caches pid, lpToken, stakingToken and rewarder at construction and forwards them without checking they still match the Pool struct WombatStaking holds, so a pool that was re-registered or removed leaves the helper acting on a stale identity. Precondition: the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative.
- Invariant to test: a helper must revalidate the pool identity it acts on before moving value; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, have the attacker run `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` versus `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
