# Q2198: receive_txn_thread compute undercharge

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `receive_txn_thread` by use json-rpc `sendtransaction` from one low-rate client with serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and duplicate-signature timing such that attacker-chosen instruction graphs consume materially more compute than the path here appears to meter, breaking the invariant that runtime work must be fully covered by compute metering before commit and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs::receive_txn_thread
- Entrypoint: use JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from one low-rate client
- Attacker controls: serialized transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and duplicate-signature timing
- Exploit idea: look for work that escapes the intended compute meter or is charged too late
- Invariant to test: runtime work must be fully covered by compute metering before commit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: instrument compute-meter consumption around CPI-heavy or log-heavy transactions
