# Q5038: total-assets via accrue: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `accrue` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
