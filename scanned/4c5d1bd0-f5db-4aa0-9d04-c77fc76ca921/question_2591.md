# Q2591: Duplicate queue or processing state in storage_verify

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `storage_verify` twice with attacker-controlled the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and violating the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/storage_proof.rs::storage_verify
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
