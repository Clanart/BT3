# Q5126: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, where WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Assuming the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` and `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, breaking the invariant that the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal and producing Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Precondition: the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling.
- Invariant to test: the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, call `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, and assert `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` equals `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
