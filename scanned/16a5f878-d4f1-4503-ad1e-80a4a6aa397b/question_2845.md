# Q2845: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getRewards - totalStaked and balanceOf drawn from unrelated sources

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, totalStaked() reads IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply() while balanceOf() reads MasterMagpie's UserInfo.amount for the same account, so the numerator and the denominator of every reward computation come from two independently maintained ledgers. Starting from a state where a large MGP distribution has just been queued and no account has settled yet, can an unprivileged EOA use `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` to leave `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` inconsistent with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`, violating the invariant that sum of balanceOf over all accounts must equal totalStaked at all times and extracting Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: totalStaked and balanceOf drawn from unrelated sources)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: totalStaked() reads IERC20(vlMGP).totalSupply() while balanceOf() reads MasterMagpie's UserInfo.amount for the same account, so the numerator and the denominator of every reward computation come from two independently maintained ledgers. Precondition: a large MGP distribution has just been queued and no account has settled yet.
- Invariant to test: sum of balanceOf over all accounts must equal totalStaked at all times; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish a large MGP distribution has just been queued and no account has settled yet, have the attacker run `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` versus `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
