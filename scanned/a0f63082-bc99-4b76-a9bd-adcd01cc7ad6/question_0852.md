# Q852: NEAR claim_fee entry recipient or fee-recipient rebinding via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `claim_fee` proof-submission flow` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `recipient or fee-recipient rebinding` under verifies a `FinTransfer` proof and forwards the predecessor account into `claim_fee_callback` for fee release, violating `fee claims must remain uniquely bound to one already-finalized destination event and one authentic fee recipient`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee`
- Entrypoint: `public `claim_fee` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and caller identity as purported fee recipient
- Exploit idea: Exploit optional fee-recipient fields, fast-transfer relayer substitution, or predecessor-captured identities. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: fee claims must remain uniquely bound to one already-finalized destination event and one authentic fee recipient
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Build pairs of proofs/messages that vary only in recipient-oriented fields and assert that settlement, fee claim, and event emission stay bound to one tuple. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
