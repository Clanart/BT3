# Q2300: retry_durable_nonce_transactions reserved-key bypass

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `retry_durable_nonce_transactions` by use json-rpc `sendtransaction` from one low-rate client with durable nonce transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and queue pressure such that duplicated accounts or versioned message features let attacker-controlled keys slip past reserved-key assumptions, breaking the invariant that reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs::retry_durable_nonce_transactions
- Entrypoint: use JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from one low-rate client
- Attacker controls: durable nonce transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and queue pressure
- Exploit idea: search for paths where reserved-key checks see a different key set than execution
- Invariant to test: reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: construct versioned transactions whose ALT-expanded account set changes the effective key view
