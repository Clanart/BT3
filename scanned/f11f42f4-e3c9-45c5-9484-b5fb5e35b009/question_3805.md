# Q3805: Replay context into withdraw

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.Withdraw` request or auth-bypass attempt into `ClementineOperator.Withdraw` with attacker-controlled the user `input_signature` so `withdraw` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the payout destination or payout amount to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that a withdrawal signature must bind exactly one withdrawal id, one input, one output script, and one amount, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/rpc/operator.rs::withdraw
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.Withdraw` request or auth-bypass attempt into `ClementineOperator.Withdraw`
- Attacker controls: the user `input_signature`
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed the user `input_signature` in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: a withdrawal signature must bind exactly one withdrawal id, one input, one output script, and one amount
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that mutates one withdrawal field at a time across repeated requests and assert no second valid payout / reimbursement path appears
