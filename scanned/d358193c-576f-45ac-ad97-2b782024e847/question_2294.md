# Q2294: start_user_token_flow?: An online session whose `associated_user.id` is written to the ...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `session[:shopify_user_id]` cookie and the online/offline session type) reach `start_user_token_flow? / update_user_access_scopes? / update_rails_cookie` in app/controllers/shopify_app/callback_controller.rb via GET /auth/shopify/callback with user storage configured, supplying an online session whose `associated_user.id` is written to the Rails cookie and later trusted as identity, so that the shopify_user_id used for scope decisions must come from the verified session, not a mutable Rails cookie is violated, leading to cross-user scope/identity confusion? Specifically confirm that no protected state is reachable by skipping or repeating an auth step.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/callback_controller.rb — `start_user_token_flow? / update_user_access_scopes? / update_rails_cookie`
- Entrypoint: GET /auth/shopify/callback with user storage configured
- Attacker controls: the `session[:shopify_user_id]` cookie and the online/offline session type — specifically an online session whose `associated_user.id` is written to the Rails cookie and later trusted as identity.
- Exploit idea: Walk the auth state machine out of order (skip/repeat a step) and confirm no step can be reached unauthenticated.
- Invariant to test: the shopify_user_id used for scope decisions must come from the verified session, not a mutable Rails cookie
- Expected Immunefi impact: cross-user scope/identity confusion (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: state-machine test exercising out-of-order transitions and asserting each protected state still requires verification.
