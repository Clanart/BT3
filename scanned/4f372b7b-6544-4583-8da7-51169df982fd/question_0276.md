# Q0276: vault-accrue via accrue: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update reach `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `accrue` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `vault-accrue` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
