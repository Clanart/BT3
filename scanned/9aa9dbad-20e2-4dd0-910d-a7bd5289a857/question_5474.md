# Q5474: send-tokens via liquidate-multi: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, can an unprivileged attacker make `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch varied, and assert that the value `send-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
