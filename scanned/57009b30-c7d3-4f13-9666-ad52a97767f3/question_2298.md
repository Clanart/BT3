# Q2298: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.withdraw - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Under the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, is there an unprivileged sequence of `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` that leaves `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` unreconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`, violates the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _liquidity, _minAmount and the ordering against the lockedAmount check
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, snapshot `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` and `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`, run the attacker's `withdraw(uint256 _liquidity, uint256 _minAmount)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
