# Q3423: mWomSV.cancelUnlock - matured slot decays the rewardable percent toward zero

## Question
wombat/mWomSV.sol: for a slot past endTime the percent contribution is amountInCoolDown * 1e18 * (endTime - startTime) / userTotalVlmgp / (timeNow - startTime), which decays without a floor, so delay alone confiscates a user's whole vesting entitlement. With _slotIndex and the moment the cooldown is aborted under attacker control and the mWOM balance of the locker is exactly equal to totalAmount before the action, can an unprivileged caller sequence `cancelUnlock(uint256 _slotIndex)` so that `getUserTotalLocked(user)` and `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(mWomSV,user).staked` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a user must not lose vested value merely because they redeemed late and realising High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWomSV.sol -> `cancelUnlock(uint256 _slotIndex)` (mechanism: matured slot decays the rewardable percent toward zero)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `cancelUnlock(uint256 _slotIndex)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _slotIndex and the moment the cooldown is aborted
- Exploit idea: for a slot past endTime the percent contribution is amountInCoolDown * 1e18 * (endTime - startTime) / userTotalVlmgp / (timeNow - startTime), which decays without a floor, so delay alone confiscates a user's whole vesting entitlement. Precondition: the mWOM balance of the locker is exactly equal to totalAmount before the action.
- Invariant to test: a user must not lose vested value merely because they redeemed late; concretely, `getUserTotalLocked(user)` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(mWomSV,user).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_slotIndex and the moment the cooldown is aborted) under the mWOM balance of the locker is exactly equal to totalAmount before the action, asserting on every row that a user must not lose vested value merely because they redeemed late.
