# Q5837: process_transaction_with_check: deserialize does not round-trip so txid is over different bytes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_transaction_with_check` (in `stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/transactions.rs`) via a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions), such that `consensus_deserialize` accepts bytes that re-serialize differently, breaking the invariant that serialize(deserialize(b)) == b for every accepted tx — leading to txid ambiguity / relay confusion?

## Target
- File/function: `stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/transactions.rs` -> `process_transaction_with_check`
- Entrypoint: a raw Stacks transaction the attacker crafts, signs and POSTs to a node (/v2/transactions)
- Attacker controls: the full auth structure (singlesig/multisig/order-independent/sponsored), nonce, fee, chain id, version, payload, and post-condition list, plus mutation of their own signed transactions
- Exploit idea: `consensus_deserialize` accepts bytes that re-serialize differently
- Invariant to test: serialize(deserialize(b)) == b for every accepted tx
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - txid ambiguity / relay confusion
- Fast validation: test a non-round-tripping tx
