# Q1785: get-full-position via collateral-add: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, drive `get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) — which returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-full-position` touches, run `collateral-add` with the position's existing collateral and debt composition, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
