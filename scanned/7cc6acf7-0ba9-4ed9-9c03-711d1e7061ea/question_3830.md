# Q3830: get-account-scaled-debt via repay: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), can an unprivileged attacker make `get-account-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `get-account-scaled-debt` reads one scaled debt row, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307` -> `get-account-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `get-account-scaled-debt` reads one scaled debt row. Reach it through `repay` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) varied, and assert that the value `get-account-scaled-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
