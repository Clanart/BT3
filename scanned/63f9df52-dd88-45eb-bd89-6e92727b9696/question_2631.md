# Q2631: DeductFeeDecorator.AnteHandle - Zero Gas At Block Height Zero Creates Production Undercharge After Upgrade

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `Cosmos ante fee deduction for txs routed through Ethermint ante` while controlling `baseFee` and `multi-message ordering`, under the precondition that baseFee changed at BeginBlock, drive `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas` in `ante/evm/nativefee.go::DeductFeeDecorator.AnteHandle` so that zero gas at block height zero creates production undercharge after upgrade, violating the invariant that baseFee and effectiveGasPrice must be consistent across ante, execution, and refund, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `ante/evm/nativefee.go::DeductFeeDecorator.AnteHandle`
- Entrypoint: `Cosmos ante fee deduction for txs routed through Ethermint ante`
- Attacker controls: `baseFee`, `multi-message ordering`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: zero gas at block height zero creates production undercharge after upgrade through `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas`.
- Invariant to test: baseFee and effectiveGasPrice must be consistent across ante, execution, and refund.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: replay the same scenario through eth_call or estimateGas and through eth_sendRawTransaction and assert the only difference is persistence.
