# Q2234: Solana finalize_transfer nonce bitmap shared proof response reused across entrypoints via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public inbound Solana flow through `finalize_transfer` and `finalize_transfer_sol`` and then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs plus finalize instruction` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `shared proof response reused across entrypoints` under buckets destination nonces into multiple PDAs and compensates rent as the highest observed nonce advances, violating `cross-PDA nonce accounting must not let a replay land in an uninitialized bucket or refund reserve lamports while keeping the nonce marked unused`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs plus finalize instruction`
- Entrypoint: `public inbound Solana flow through `finalize_transfer` and `finalize_transfer_sol``
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, PDA bucket index, payer rent, and initialization order
- Exploit idea: Attack systems where one verifier contract serves deploy, finalize, metadata, and fee-claim flows with a shared result type. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: cross-PDA nonce accounting must not let a replay land in an uninitialized bucket or refund reserve lamports while keeping the nonce marked unused
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Attempt to route accepted verifier outputs into every public proof consumer and assert that each entrypoint only accepts its intended result variant and source semantics. Then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
