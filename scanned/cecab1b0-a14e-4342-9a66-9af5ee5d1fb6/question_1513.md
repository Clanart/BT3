# Q1513: check_fee_payer_unlocked artifact memory blowup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `check_fee_payer_unlocked` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with fee-payer aliases, duplicate accounts, rent edge cases, and batch ordering such that logs, return data, inner instructions, or side-channel artifacts created downstream scale much faster than request size, breaking the invariant that execution artifact growth must stay bounded per transaction and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/banking_stage/consumer.rs::check_fee_payer_unlocked
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: fee-payer aliases, duplicate accounts, rent edge cases, and batch ordering
- Exploit idea: use legal execution artifacts as the amplifier instead of raw packet size
- Invariant to test: execution artifact growth must stay bounded per transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: run the same heavy transaction repeatedly and correlate artifact size with resident memory
