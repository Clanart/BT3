# Q3094: zip via redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `min-out`, can an unprivileged attacker make `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with `min-out`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
