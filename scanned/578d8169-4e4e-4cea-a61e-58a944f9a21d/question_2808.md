# Q2808: roots_to_flush read-only cache incoherence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `roots_to_flush` by submit transactions that keep many roots dirty while reading hot accounts with heavy write churn across nearby roots plus immediate reads so that read-only caching can return a version that writable/runtime paths would reject as stale, breaking the invariant that read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::roots_to_flush
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that keep many roots dirty while reading hot accounts
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn across nearby roots plus immediate reads
- Exploit idea: diff read-only and runtime-visible answers for the same account
- Invariant to test: read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare read-only cache results to direct runtime/bank reads after writes
