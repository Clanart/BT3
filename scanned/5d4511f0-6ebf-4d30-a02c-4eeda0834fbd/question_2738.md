# Q2738: NEAR sign_transfer native versus wrapped branch switch via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public `sign_transfer` on a pending transfer id` and then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::sign_transfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `native versus wrapped branch switch` under loads a stored transfer, normalizes the amount using destination token decimals, parses destination message, and asks MPC to sign a `TransferMessagePayload` for the destination chain, violating `every stored transfer must hash to one unambiguous outbound payload with one fee model, one token mapping, and one recipient intent`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::sign_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public `sign_transfer` on a pending transfer id`
- Attacker controls: transfer id, optional fee recipient, optional fee override, attached deposit, and any stored transfer fields reachable through the chosen id
- Exploit idea: Target zero-address, deployed-token, custom-minter, native-vault, or bridge-token branch predicates. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: every stored transfer must hash to one unambiguous outbound payload with one fee model, one token mapping, and one recipient intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each branch predicate to flip around callbacks or mapping writes and assert that the same source asset can never produce two incompatible custody models. Then replay or reorder the later settlement leg on another chain and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
