# Q257: Starknet log_metadata malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public Starknet metadata logging entrypoint` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::log_metadata` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity` under performs low-level calls to infer whether metadata fields are returned as `felt252` or `ByteArray`, then emits a `LogMetadata` event, violating `metadata parsing across old and new Starknet token ABIs must not let one token produce ambiguous asset identity data on other chains`?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::log_metadata`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet metadata logging entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: token address and the token’s reported `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` ABI behavior
- Exploit idea: Exploit arbitrary token metadata calls, old/new ABI switching, or malformed strings in metadata proofs. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: metadata parsing across old and new Starknet token ABIs must not let one token produce ambiguous asset identity data on other chains
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Publish or prove pathological metadata values and assert that downstream deployment and mapping logic still binds to the right remote asset and decimals. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
