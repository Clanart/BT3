# Q2742: calc-treasury-lp-preview via supply-collateral-add: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `calc-treasury-lp-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
