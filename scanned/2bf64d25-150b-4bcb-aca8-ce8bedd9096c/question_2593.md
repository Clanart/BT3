# Q2593: find-superset via collateral-remove: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262) — which returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262` -> `find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `find-superset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
