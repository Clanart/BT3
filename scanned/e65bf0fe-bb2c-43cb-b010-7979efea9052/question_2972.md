# Q2972: notify_slot_status is not deterministic across nodes (optimistically_confirmed_bank_tracker.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `notify_slot_status` in `rpc/src/optimistically_confirmed_bank_tracker.rs` with an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure, and make the transaction status recorded at commit disagree with the status returned by the status query, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `notify_slot_status` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/optimistically_confirmed_bank_tracker.rs` -> `notify_slot_status()` (around line 176)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure
- Exploit idea: Find input to `notify_slot_status` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `notify_slot_status` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `notify_slot_status` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy or upgrade a program, or poison the program cache, so honest validators execute different bytecode or produce different results for the same instruction.
