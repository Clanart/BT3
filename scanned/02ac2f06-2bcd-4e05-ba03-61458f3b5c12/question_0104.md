# Q0104: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Does `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, so that `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` diverges from `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`, the invariant that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent is broken, and the result is High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Precondition: the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative.
- Invariant to test: an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` must stay reconciled with `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence atomically under the pool's deposit token is wBNB and the caller arrived through depositNative, asserting at the end that `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) delta` still equals `IMasterMagpie(masterMagpie).stakingInfo(stakingToken,_for).staked` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
