# Q1956: linear-interpolate via deposit: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-out` reach `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `deposit` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-out` across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `linear-interpolate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
