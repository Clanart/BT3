# Q4941: MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec - lpSupply inflation by direct token donation

## Question
rewards/MasterMagpie.sol: _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Under the staking token is a Wombat receipt token minted by WombatStaking with 18 decimals, is there an unprivileged sequence of `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)` that leaves `mgpPerSec` unreconciled with `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(masterMagpie)`, violates the invariant that MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply, and delivers High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: lpSupply inflation by direct token donation)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: both outer and inner arrays, so every reward-token address and its order
- Exploit idea: _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Precondition: the staking token is a Wombat receipt token minted by WombatStaking with 18 decimals.
- Invariant to test: MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply; concretely, `mgpPerSec` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(masterMagpie)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `multiclaimSpec(address[] _stakingTokens, address[][] _rewardTokens)` sequence atomically under the staking token is a Wombat receipt token minted by WombatStaking with 18 decimals, asserting at the end that `mgpPerSec` still equals `IERC20(mgp).balanceOf(masterMagpie)` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
