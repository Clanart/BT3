# Q968: Keeper.ApplyMessageWithConfig - Debugtrace Fee Path Mutates State When Commit True

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call a malicious contract from an unprivileged EOA through `EVM CALL/CREATE execution from a valid Ethereum transaction` while controlling `calldata` and `value`, under the precondition that a contract performs nested CALL/CREATE and reverts one frame, drive `ApplyMessageWithConfig -> Prepare -> EVM CALL/CREATE -> gas/refund calculation -> StateDB.Commit` in `x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go::Keeper.ApplyMessageWithConfig` so that DebugTrace fee path mutates state when commit=true, violating the invariant that simulation and committed execution must only differ by persistence, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go::Keeper.ApplyMessageWithConfig`
- Entrypoint: `EVM CALL/CREATE execution from a valid Ethereum transaction`
- Attacker controls: `calldata`, `value`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: DebugTrace fee path mutates state when commit=true through `ApplyMessageWithConfig -> Prepare -> EVM CALL/CREATE -> gas/refund calculation -> StateDB.Commit`.
- Invariant to test: simulation and committed execution must only differ by persistence.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: add a fuzz case varying the attacker-controlled fields and differential-check against go-ethereum for tx validity, gas, nonce, and code/storage effects.
