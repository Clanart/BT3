# Q2720: accounts_cache.load write-cache ordering drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by submit transactions plus immediate reads for recently changed accounts with same-pubkey churn plus immediate readback so that writeback ordering can make later readers observe a different account version than accounting code assumed, breaking the invariant that write-cache ordering must preserve one coherent latest-account view and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::load
- Entrypoint: submit transactions plus immediate reads for recently changed accounts
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey churn plus immediate readback
- Exploit idea: search for ordering-sensitive reads around flush/writeback boundaries
- Invariant to test: write-cache ordering must preserve one coherent latest-account view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace storage writes and immediate reads during slot/root churn
