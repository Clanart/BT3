# Q3328: Break reimbursement recoverability in internal_send_tx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.InternalSendTx` request with crafted the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering so `internal_send_tx` moves the protocol past the point where reimbursement should remain recoverable, leaving the reimbursement path that must remain slashable and recoverable inconsistent with the assumption that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, and leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/rpc/aggregator.rs::internal_send_tx
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.InternalSendTx` request
- Attacker controls: the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering
- Exploit idea: move bridge state forward while reimbursement/slashability stays tied to older state
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
