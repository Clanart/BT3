# Q5526: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.deposit - receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary

## Question
In wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Does `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, so that `pid cached at construction` diverges from `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, the invariant that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution is broken, and the result is Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Precondition: MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed.
- Invariant to test: the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity) under MasterMagpie is paused so depositFor reverts while the Wombat leg has already executed, asserting on every row that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution.
