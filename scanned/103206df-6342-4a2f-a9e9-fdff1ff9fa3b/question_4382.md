# Q4382: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, where WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Assuming the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` via `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, breaking the invariant that the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal and producing Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Precondition: the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body.
- Invariant to test: the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence atomically under the pool's rewarder is a V1 rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol with an empty getRewards body, asserting at the end that `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` still equals `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
