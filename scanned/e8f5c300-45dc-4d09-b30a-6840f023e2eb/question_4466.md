# Q4466: BaseRewardPoolV2.updateFor - rewardTokens array grows without bound and without removal

## Question
In rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol, queueNewRewards() and _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer() push into rewardTokens with no way to remove an entry, and getReward()/updateFor() iterate the whole array, so a token that starts reverting on transfer makes the claim-all path revert for every staker forever. Starting from a state where the attacker calls the function twice in the same block to observe the second, early-continued iteration, can an unprivileged EOA use `updateFor(address _account)` to leave `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` inconsistent with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`, violating the invariant that one misbehaving reward token must not be able to block settlement of the remaining reward tokens and extracting High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPoolV2.sol -> `updateFor(address _account)` (mechanism: rewardTokens array grows without bound and without removal)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `updateFor(address _account)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted
- Exploit idea: queueNewRewards() and _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer() push into rewardTokens with no way to remove an entry, and getReward()/updateFor() iterate the whole array, so a token that starts reverting on transfer makes the claim-all path revert for every staker forever. Precondition: the attacker calls the function twice in the same block to observe the second, early-continued iteration.
- Invariant to test: one misbehaving reward token must not be able to block settlement of the remaining reward tokens; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted) under the attacker calls the function twice in the same block to observe the second, early-continued iteration, asserting on every row that one misbehaving reward token must not be able to block settlement of the remaining reward tokens.
