# Q2883: vlMGPBaseRewarder.getRewards - _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer credits value with no matching balance

## Question
In rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol, _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer() raises historicalRewards and rewardPerTokenStored without any token transfer, relying on the forfeited amount already sitting in the contract, so any path that reaches it without a real retained balance promises tokens the pool does not hold. Starting from a state where a large MGP distribution has just been queued and no account has settled yet, can an unprivileged EOA use `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` to leave `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` inconsistent with `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored`, violating the invariant that the reward index may only be raised against tokens the contract has actually retained and extracting Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/vlMGPBaseRewarder.sol -> `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)` (mechanism: _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer credits value with no matching balance)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getRewards(address _account, address _receiver, address[] _rewardTokens)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the reward-token array, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaimSpec and multiclaimFor
- Exploit idea: _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer() raises historicalRewards and rewardPerTokenStored without any token transfer, relying on the forfeited amount already sitting in the contract, so any path that reaches it without a real retained balance promises tokens the pool does not hold. Precondition: a large MGP distribution has just been queued and no account has settled yet.
- Invariant to test: the reward index may only be raised against tokens the contract has actually retained; concretely, `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` must stay reconciled with `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under a large MGP distribution has just been queued and no account has settled yet, then assert `userRewards[_rewardToken][account]` and `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` end identical in both runs.
