# Q1225: NEAR OmniToken mint delivery callback leaves inconsistent state at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public bridge-token mint path via controller-only callback reached from bridge delivery` with boundary-controlled inputs covering zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and make `near/omni-token/src/lib.rs::mint` violate `mint-with-message and plain mint must be economically equivalent and must not create balances on the controller or recipient that survive inconsistent callback outcomes` in the `delivery callback leaves inconsistent state` attack class because controller-only mint either deposits directly or first credits the predecessor account then calls `ft_transfer_call` to the recipient when `msg` is present becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-token/src/lib.rs::mint`
- Entrypoint: `public bridge-token mint path via controller-only callback reached from bridge delivery`
- Attacker controls: recipient account, amount, optional `msg`, and any receiver behavior in `ft_transfer_call`
- Exploit idea: Focus on `ft_transfer_call`, unwrap callbacks, and post-delivery resolution that decide whether to burn, refund, or remove records. Concentrate on zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values.
- Invariant to test: mint-with-message and plain mint must be economically equivalent and must not create balances on the controller or recipient that survive inconsistent callback outcomes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Enumerate callback results and assert that each result maps to exactly one consistent combination of delivered value, replay state, and storage refund. Sweep boundary values for zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
