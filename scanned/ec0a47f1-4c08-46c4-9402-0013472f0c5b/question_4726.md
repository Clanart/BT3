# Q4726: accrue via borrow: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835` -> `accrue`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale. Reach it through `borrow` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
