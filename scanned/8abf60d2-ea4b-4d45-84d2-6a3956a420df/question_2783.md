# Q2783: calc-final-liquidation-amounts via liquidate-multi: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`calc-final-liquidation-amounts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:834) recomputes debt proportionally when collateral was capped, a SECOND re-derivation after `process-debt-asset` already capped once. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the full batch list and its ordering, use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:834` -> `calc-final-liquidation-amounts`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` recomputes debt proportionally when collateral was capped, a SECOND re-derivation after `process-debt-asset` already capped once. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the full batch list and its ordering, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
