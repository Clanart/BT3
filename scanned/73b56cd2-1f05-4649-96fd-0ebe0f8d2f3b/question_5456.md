# Q5456: mask-to-list-collateral via liquidate-multi: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) in a state where it apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? Given that it expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64, the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with the full batch list and its ordering varied, and assert that the value `mask-to-list-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
