# Q1201: Exploit ordering assumptions in total_work_and_watchtower_flags

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use attacker-controlled the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering so `total_work_and_watchtower_flags` validates the right inputs in the wrong order, corrupting the storage-proof key/value binding used for deposit or withdrawal validation and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/mod.rs::total_work_and_watchtower_flags
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Exploit idea: validate the right pieces in the wrong order using the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
