# Q1659: Exploit witness/annex edge cases in convert_to_groth16_and_verify

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit witness, annex, or script-path edge cases in reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height so `convert_to_groth16_and_verify` verifies a different Bitcoin statement than later settlement relies on, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/mod.rs::convert_to_groth16_and_verify
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: make verification hash a different Bitcoin statement than settlement later uses via reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
