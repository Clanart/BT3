# Q5415: check-confidence via collateral-remove-redeem: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
`check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, use that to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `check-confidence` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
