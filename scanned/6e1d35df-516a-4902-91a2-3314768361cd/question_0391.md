# Q391: Replay context into save_get_block_proof

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with attacker-controlled the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit` so `save_get_block_proof` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the verifier nonce session that a final signature is supposed to consume to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/header_chain_prover.rs::save_get_block_proof
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit` in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
