# Q3532: receive: A forged body that passes only if HMAC verification is bypassed...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `:type` route segment, the raw body, and all webhook headers) reach `receive` in app/controllers/shopify_app/webhooks_controller.rb via POST /webhooks/:type, supplying a forged body that passes only if HMAC verification is bypassed (tied to hmac_valid?), so that no webhook side effect may run before HMAC verification succeeds over the raw body is violated, leading to forged webhook processing (unauthorized state change)? Specifically confirm that merchant A can never load, write, or act with merchant B's session, token, or scopes.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/shopify_app/webhooks_controller.rb — `receive`
- Entrypoint: POST /webhooks/:type
- Attacker controls: the `:type` route segment, the raw body, and all webhook headers — specifically a forged body that passes only if HMAC verification is bypassed (tied to hmac_valid?).
- Exploit idea: Perform the flow as merchant A while naming shop/user B and confirm no B-scoped data is reachable.
- Invariant to test: no webhook side effect may run before HMAC verification succeeds over the raw body
- Expected Immunefi impact: forged webhook processing (unauthorized state change) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: two-tenant integration test asserting A's request never loads, writes, or acts with B's session/token.
