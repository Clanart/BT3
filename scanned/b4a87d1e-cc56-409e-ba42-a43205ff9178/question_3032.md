# Q3032: NEAR sign_transfer native versus wrapped branch switch at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public `sign_transfer` on a pending transfer id` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::sign_transfer` violate `every stored transfer must hash to one unambiguous outbound payload with one fee model, one token mapping, and one recipient intent` in the `native versus wrapped branch switch` attack class because loads a stored transfer, normalizes the amount using destination token decimals, parses destination message, and asks MPC to sign a `TransferMessagePayload` for the destination chain becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::sign_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public `sign_transfer` on a pending transfer id`
- Attacker controls: transfer id, optional fee recipient, optional fee override, attached deposit, and any stored transfer fields reachable through the chosen id
- Exploit idea: Target zero-address, deployed-token, custom-minter, native-vault, or bridge-token branch predicates. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: every stored transfer must hash to one unambiguous outbound payload with one fee model, one token mapping, and one recipient intent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each branch predicate to flip around callbacks or mapping writes and assert that the same source asset can never produce two incompatible custody models. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
