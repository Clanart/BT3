# Q2126: from produce a Rust/Python disagreement via list and vector length fields

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker relay network payload bytes through streamable decoding targeting `from` in `crates/chia-protocol/src/bytes.rs` with list and vector length fields when serialized bytes are validly framed but semantically adversarial make chia_rs produce a Rust/Python disagreement, violating the invariant that integer and length encodings cannot change hashes across implementations, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-protocol/src/bytes.rs:361` / `from`
- Entrypoint: relay network payload bytes through streamable decoding
- Attacker controls: list and vector length fields
- Exploit idea: Drive `from` through its public caller path using list and vector length fields; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: integer and length encodings cannot change hashes across implementations
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Streamable/CLVM/serde/Python/wasm boundary parsing bug causes non-canonical bytes, integer confusion, hash mismatch, or cross-language disagreement in consensus-critical data
- Fast validation: differential-test JSON dict conversion against streamable bytes.
