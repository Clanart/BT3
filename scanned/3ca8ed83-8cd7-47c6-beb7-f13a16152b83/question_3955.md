# Q3955: CheckSenderBalance - Negative Cost From Malformed Tx Bypasses Balance Check

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a valid transaction with adversarial gas and fee fields through `ante sender balance check for Ethereum tx cost` while controlling `EVM-denom balance` and `leftoverGas`, under the precondition that the transaction consumes near its gas limit but remains valid, drive `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas` in `x/evm/keeper/utils.go::CheckSenderBalance` so that negative cost from malformed tx bypasses balance check, violating the invariant that a valid tx must never receive a refund greater than escrowed fees, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/keeper/utils.go::CheckSenderBalance`
- Entrypoint: `ante sender balance check for Ethereum tx cost`
- Attacker controls: `EVM-denom balance`, `leftoverGas`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: negative cost from malformed tx bypasses balance check through `NewDynamicFeeChecker -> DeductFeeDecorator -> EthereumTx -> ResetGasMeterAndConsumeGas`.
- Invariant to test: a valid tx must never receive a refund greater than escrowed fees.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: add a fuzz case varying the attacker-controlled fields and differential-check against go-ethereum for tx validity, gas, nonce, and code/storage effects.
