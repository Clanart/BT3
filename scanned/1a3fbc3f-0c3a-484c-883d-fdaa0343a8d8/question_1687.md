# Q1687: min_ongoing_scan_root_from_btree confuses account types or owners (accounts_scan.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `min_ongoing_scan_root_from_btree` in `accounts-db/src/accounts_scan.rs` with a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write, and have `min_ongoing_scan_root_from_btree` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`min_ongoing_scan_root_from_btree` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/accounts_scan.rs` -> `min_ongoing_scan_root_from_btree()` (around line 80)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: a lookup whose result is cached and then invalidated by the attacker's own write
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `min_ongoing_scan_root_from_btree` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `min_ongoing_scan_root_from_btree` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `min_ongoing_scan_root_from_btree` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy a program that reads or writes host/guest memory outside its permitted regions, or forges an account reference, and extracts or corrupts state belonging to other accounts.
