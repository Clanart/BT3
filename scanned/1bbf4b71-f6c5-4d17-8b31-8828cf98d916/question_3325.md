# Q3325: send-tokens via liquidate-redeem: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the borrower targeted, drive `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) — which pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, then read `send-tokens` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
