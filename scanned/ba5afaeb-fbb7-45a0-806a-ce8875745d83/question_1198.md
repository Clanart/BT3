# Q1198: NEAR add_fin_transfer storage-preparation omission changes settlement meaning at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `internal finalization-state writer reached from public finalize flows` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::add_fin_transfer` violate `finalization writes must be globally unique and must not be reverted or duplicated in ways that reopen the same bridge event` in the `storage-preparation omission changes settlement meaning` attack class because inserts a transfer id into `finalised_transfers` and charges storage for that finalized record becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::add_fin_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `internal finalization-state writer reached from public finalize flows`
- Attacker controls: transfer id chosen from source event and the timing of repeat calls
- Exploit idea: Target recipient or fee-recipient storage checks that gate token delivery or fee minting. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: finalization writes must be globally unique and must not be reverted or duplicated in ways that reopen the same bridge event
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Reorder or omit storage-deposit actions and assert that settlement either fully aborts before finalization or completes with all intended recipients properly provisioned. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
