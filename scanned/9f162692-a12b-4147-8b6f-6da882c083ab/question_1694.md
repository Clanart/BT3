# Q1694: Exploit witness/annex edge cases in calculate_work

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit witness, annex, or script-path edge cases in the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering so `calculate_work` verifies a different Bitcoin statement than later settlement relies on, corrupting the kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove context treated as canonical for a deposit and violating the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/header_chain/mod.rs::calculate_work
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Exploit idea: make verification hash a different Bitcoin statement than settlement later uses via the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
