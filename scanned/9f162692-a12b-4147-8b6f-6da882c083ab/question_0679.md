# Q679: Exploit reorg boundary handling in fetch_new_blocks

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit reorg timing around reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height so `fetch_new_blocks` treats a non-canonical object as canonical long enough to mutate bridge state, corrupting the kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove context treated as canonical for a deposit and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/bitcoin_syncer.rs::fetch_new_blocks
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: reorder or replay reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height across canonical and non-canonical views
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
