# Q1987: Confuse replacement linkage in tx_sign_preimage

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit` so `tx_sign_preimage` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the verifier nonce session that a final signature is supposed to consume to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/actor.rs::tx_sign_preimage
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `recovery_taproot_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
