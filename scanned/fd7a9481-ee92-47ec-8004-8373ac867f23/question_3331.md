# Q3331: Bypass settlement gating in internal_finalized_payout

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft the optional `verification_signature` wrapper so `internal_finalized_payout` satisfies its local gating checks for the wrong bridge action, corrupting the mapping between a withdrawal and the deposit it spends against and violating the invariant that a withdrawal signature must bind exactly one withdrawal id, one input, one output script, and one amount, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/rpc/operator.rs::internal_finalized_payout
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.Withdraw` request or auth-bypass attempt into `ClementineOperator.Withdraw`
- Attacker controls: the optional `verification_signature` wrapper
- Exploit idea: make local checks pass for the wrong bridge action via the optional `verification_signature` wrapper
- Invariant to test: a withdrawal signature must bind exactly one withdrawal id, one input, one output script, and one amount
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that mutates one withdrawal field at a time across repeated requests and assert no second valid payout / reimbursement path appears
