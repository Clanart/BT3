# Q3769: normalize-pyth via collateral-add: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, drive `normalize-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297) — which computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint` — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297` -> `normalize-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `normalize-pyth` computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`. Reach it through `collateral-add` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with the position's existing collateral and debt composition, then read `normalize-pyth` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
