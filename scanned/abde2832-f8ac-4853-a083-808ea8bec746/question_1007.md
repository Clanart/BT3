# Q1007: load_execute_and_commit_transactions_with_pre_commit_callback status visibility race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_execute_and_commit_transactions_with_pre_commit_callback` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with versioned messages, alt-heavy account sets, cpi depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets such that signature or execution status may become externally visible before the underlying state is durably consistent, breaking the invariant that externally visible status must track durable runtime state transitions and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::load_execute_and_commit_transactions_with_pre_commit_callback
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, ALT-heavy account sets, CPI depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: surface an impossible early success/failure state
- Invariant to test: externally visible status must track durable runtime state transitions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare status-cache visibility to actual commit points under repeated retries
