# Q2625: read_only_accounts_cache.load load/store torn read

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads that repeatedly fetch recently changed accounts with rapid read-after-write patterns against the same accounts so that one caller can read a mix of pre-update and post-update fields because load and store paths disagree on version boundaries, breaking the invariant that one account read must resolve to one coherent version of that account and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/read_only_accounts_cache.rs::load
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads that repeatedly fetch recently changed accounts
- Attacker controls: rapid read-after-write patterns against the same accounts
- Exploit idea: seek field-level incoherence, not just old-vs-new whole values
- Invariant to test: one account read must resolve to one coherent version of that account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: diff lamports, data length, owner, and payload fields returned by immediate read-after-write patterns
