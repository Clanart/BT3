# Q337: Desync metadata inside attempt_sign_psbt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit the `rbf_signing_info` object through public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction so `attempt_sign_psbt` stores or uses metadata that describes a different intent than the raw transaction/proof it later sends, corrupting the fee-payer UTXO chain selected for CPFP/RBF and violating the invariant that database state must not say a send path is finalized / active when the raw transaction path says otherwise, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/rbf.rs::attempt_sign_psbt
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `rbf_signing_info` object
- Exploit idea: make raw bytes and persisted metadata describe different intents using the `rbf_signing_info` object
- Invariant to test: database state must not say a send path is finalized / active when the raw transaction path says otherwise
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
