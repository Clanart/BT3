# Q1666: Exploit witness/annex edge cases in assert_single_op_return_commitment_outputs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit witness, annex, or script-path edge cases in multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context so `assert_single_op_return_commitment_outputs` verifies a different Bitcoin statement than later settlement relies on, corrupting the storage-proof key/value binding used for deposit or withdrawal validation and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/bridge_circuit_host.rs::assert_single_op_return_commitment_outputs
- Entrypoint: broadcast a crafted Bitcoin kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transaction that later reaches sync and verifier logic
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: make verification hash a different Bitcoin statement than settlement later uses via multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
