# Q3564: unpack-u16 via redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-out` reach `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-out` across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `unpack-u16` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
