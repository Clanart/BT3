# Q5183: refresh via repay: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `repay` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
