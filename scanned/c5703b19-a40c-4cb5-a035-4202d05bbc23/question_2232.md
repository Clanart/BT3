# Q2232: NEAR UTXO fast resolver fee recipient can be substituted or reclaimed by attacker via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public UTXO fast path reached through `ft_on_transfer`` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::utxo_fin_transfer_fast` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `fee recipient can be substituted or reclaimed by attacker` under finalizes or removes a UTXO fast transfer depending on whether the destination is Near or another chain, violating `the same UTXO fast-transfer id must not both pay a relayer immediately and remain claimable on a second leg`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::utxo_fin_transfer_fast`
- Entrypoint: `public UTXO fast path reached through `ft_on_transfer``
- Attacker controls: fast-transfer id, stored fast-transfer status, destination chain, amount, and relayer recipient
- Exploit idea: Target optional fee-recipient fields, predecessor-captured identities, and relayer substitution on fast paths. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: the same UTXO fast-transfer id must not both pay a relayer immediately and remain claimable on a second leg
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Settle and claim with varied fee-recipient encodings and assert that only the intended recipient can ever collect that fee. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
