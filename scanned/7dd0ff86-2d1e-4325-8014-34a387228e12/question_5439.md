# Q5439: accrue-user-collateral via repay: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
`accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, use that to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `repay` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-user-collateral` touches, run `repay` with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
