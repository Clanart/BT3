# Q959: load_and_execute_transactions program-deployment race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_and_execute_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with versioned messages, alt-heavy account sets, cpi depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets such that loader state and runtime state can disagree about whether a program version is executable when this function runs, breaking the invariant that program executability must be consistent across loader and runtime checks and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::load_and_execute_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, ALT-heavy account sets, CPI depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: look for invocation windows around deploy/upgrade/close boundaries
- Invariant to test: program executability must be consistent across loader and runtime checks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race upgrade/close transactions against repeated invocation of the same program id
