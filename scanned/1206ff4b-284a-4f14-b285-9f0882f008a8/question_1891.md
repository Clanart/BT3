# Q1891: deploy_program account-size meter wrap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `deploy_program` by submit transactions invoking the upgradeable bpf loader without trusted authority with loader instruction sequences, duplicated accounts, programdata sizes, and boundary elf payloads such that account-size or memory-region arithmetic may wrap, saturate, or truncate on attacker-chosen boundaries, breaking the invariant that size meters and offsets must match true account memory bounds and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/deploy.rs::deploy_program
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking the upgradeable BPF loader without trusted authority
- Attacker controls: loader instruction sequences, duplicated accounts, programdata sizes, and boundary ELF payloads
- Exploit idea: search for silent integer boundary behavior in size/accounting code
- Invariant to test: size meters and offsets must match true account memory bounds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: hit the largest legal account sizes and offset combinations
