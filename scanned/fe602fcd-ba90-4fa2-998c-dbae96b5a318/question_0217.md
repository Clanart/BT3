# Q217: NEAR Wormhole prover verify_vaa_callback state update before full validation via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `callback after external Wormhole verification` and then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step so that `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/lib.rs::verify_vaa_callback` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `state update before full validation` under decodes hex, parses the VAA structure, checks that the first payload byte matches the expected proof kind, and converts it into a typed `ProverResult`, violating `callback parsing must never let an attacker swap message class, emitter identity, or payload fields after external validity has already been accepted`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/lib.rs::verify_vaa_callback`
- Entrypoint: `callback after external Wormhole verification`
- Attacker controls: proof kind, VAA bytes, callback success/failure, and local payload parsing
- Exploit idea: Look for `completed`, `finalised`, or bitmap writes that happen before every branch-specific validation step and external effect. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: callback parsing must never let an attacker swap message class, emitter identity, or payload fields after external validity has already been accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force later validation or delivery to fail after replay state was consumed and assert that the transfer cannot be stranded or reopened inconsistently. Then replay or reorder later bind, deploy, or metadata-consumption step and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
