# Q2917: parse_confidential_transfer_fee_instruction confuses account types or owners (confidential_transfer_fee.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `parse_confidential_transfer_fee_instruction` in `transaction-status/src/parse_token/extension/confidential_transfer_fee.rs` with integer fields at u64::MAX / i64::MIN so the conversion wraps or saturates, and have `parse_confidential_transfer_fee_instruction` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`parse_confidential_transfer_fee_instruction` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-status/src/parse_token/extension/confidential_transfer_fee.rs` -> `parse_confidential_transfer_fee_instruction()` (around line 10)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: integer fields at u64::MAX / i64::MIN so the conversion wraps or saturates
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `parse_confidential_transfer_fee_instruction` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `parse_confidential_transfer_fee_instruction` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `parse_confidential_transfer_fee_instruction` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy a program that reads or writes host/guest memory outside its permitted regions, or forges an account reference, and extracts or corrupts state belonging to other accounts.
