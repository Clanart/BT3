# Q2893: notify_gossip_subscribers valid-input crash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_gossip_subscribers` by trigger in-scope subscriptions and then submit transactions that generate hot notifications with subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams so that validly encoded account/notification state or subscription flow can still reach a panic or abort, breaking the invariant that valid inputs and valid subscription flows must not crash this path and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_gossip_subscribers
- Entrypoint: trigger in-scope subscriptions and then submit transactions that generate hot notifications
- Attacker controls: subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams
- Exploit idea: treat state-filtering and watcher code as crash surfaces
- Invariant to test: valid inputs and valid subscription flows must not crash this path
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: fuzz only valid subscription parameters and event payload shapes while monitoring for crashes
