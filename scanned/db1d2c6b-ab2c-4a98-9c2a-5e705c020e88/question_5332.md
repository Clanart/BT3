# Q5332: WombatBribeManager.unvote - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol - because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _lp and the moment the whole position on that pool is released, under the attacker passes offsetting positive and negative deltas that net to zero, exploit this through `unvote(address _lp)` to break the reconciliation between `delegatedPool votes` and `totalVlMgpInVote` and the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates, yielding Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `unvote(address _lp)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `unvote(address _lp)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lp and the moment the whole position on that pool is released
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the attacker passes offsetting positive and negative deltas that net to zero.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `delegatedPool votes` must stay reconciled with `totalVlMgpInVote`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the attacker passes offsetting positive and negative deltas that net to zero, have the attacker run `unvote(address _lp)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `delegatedPool votes` versus `totalVlMgpInVote` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
