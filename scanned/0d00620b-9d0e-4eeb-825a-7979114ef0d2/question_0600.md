# Q0600: redirect_to_login: A `host` param reflected unvalidated into `login_url_params[:ho...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (`return_to`, `shop`, `host`, the Referer header, and arbitrary extra query params) reach `redirect_to_login / return_to_url / login_url_params` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb via GET a protected action while unauthenticated (triggers redirect_to_login), supplying a `host` param reflected unvalidated into `login_url_params[:host]`, so that return_to must resolve only to a same-origin path, never an external absolute URL is violated, leading to open redirect used to steal the id_token/host on the follow-up navigation? Specifically confirm that the full public-route flow yields only a rejection or attacker-own-scope result.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb — `redirect_to_login / return_to_url / login_url_params`
- Entrypoint: GET a protected action while unauthenticated (triggers redirect_to_login)
- Attacker controls: `return_to`, `shop`, `host`, the Referer header, and arbitrary extra query params — specifically a `host` param reflected unvalidated into `login_url_params[:host]`.
- Exploit idea: Run the full public route end-to-end with the crafted input and confirm the real-world outcome is safe.
- Invariant to test: return_to must resolve only to a same-origin path, never an external absolute URL
- Expected Immunefi impact: open redirect used to steal the id_token/host on the follow-up navigation (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: end-to-end integration test through the real route asserting the attacker outcome is a reject/own-scope only.
