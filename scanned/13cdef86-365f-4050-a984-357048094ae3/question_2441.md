# Q2441: to clvm overflow or underflow a boundary check via big integer encodings

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker derive typed values from CLVM nodes targeting `to_clvm` in `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs` with big integer encodings when the same payload is parsed through public bindings make chia_rs overflow or underflow a boundary check, violating the invariant that curried argument hashes match executed programs, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/clvm-traits/src/to_clvm.rs:133` / `to_clvm`
- Entrypoint: derive typed values from CLVM nodes
- Attacker controls: big integer encodings
- Exploit idea: Drive `to_clvm` through its public caller path using big integer encodings; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: curried argument hashes match executed programs
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption
- Fast validation: round-trip ToClvm/FromClvm and compare tree hashes.
