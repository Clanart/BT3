# Q3833: create via borrow: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, drive `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) — which binds a principal to a fresh numeric id — to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, breaking the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `borrow` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
