# Q4041: oracle-timestamp-fresh via collateral-remove-redeem: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, drive `oracle-timestamp-fresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:365) — which sets `delta` to u0 whenever `ts` exceeds `stacks-block-time`, so a future timestamp is maximally fresh, then requires `(>= ts prev)` — to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:365` -> `oracle-timestamp-fresh`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `oracle-timestamp-fresh` sets `delta` to u0 whenever `ts` exceeds `stacks-block-time`, so a future timestamp is maximally fresh, then requires `(>= ts prev)`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `oracle-timestamp-fresh` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
