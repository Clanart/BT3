# Q891: simulate_transaction ALT account explosion

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `simulate_transaction` by json-rpc `simulatetransaction` with serialized transaction bytes, account-request config, sigverify / replacerecentblockhash flags, and cpi-heavy programs such that address lookup tables make this function handle a much larger effective account surface than the early admission logic prices, breaking the invariant that versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::simulate_transaction
- Entrypoint: JSON-RPC `simulateTransaction`
- Attacker controls: serialized transaction bytes, account-request config, sigVerify / replaceRecentBlockhash flags, and CPI-heavy programs
- Exploit idea: use legal ALT expansion to amplify load, lock, or verification work
- Invariant to test: versioned transactions must obey the same effective safety bounds as legacy transactions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: benchmark identical logic with and without ALT expansion
