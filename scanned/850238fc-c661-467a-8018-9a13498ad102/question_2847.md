# Q2847: get_parsed_token_account panics on attacker-reachable input (parsed_token_accounts.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `get_parsed_token_account` in `rpc/src/parsed_token_accounts.rs` with a nested structure with an attacker-chosen depth and element count, and reach an unchecked unwrap, slice index, or assertion inside `get_parsed_token_account`, so that the invariant "No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/parsed_token_accounts.rs` -> `get_parsed_token_account()` (around line 23)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: a nested structure with an attacker-chosen depth and element count
- Exploit idea: Reach `get_parsed_token_account` with input that trips an unwrap, slice index, `expect`, division, or debug assertion, aborting the process on every node that replays the block.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz `get_parsed_token_account` with `cargo fuzz`/proptest over its attacker-controlled arguments; assert no panic, only `Result::Err`.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft bytecode, ELF metadata, precompile data, or zk proof input that panics, aborts, infinite-loops, or exhausts memory inside the VM and halts every validator.
