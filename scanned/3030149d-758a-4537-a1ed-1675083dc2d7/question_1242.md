# Q1242: EVM ENearProxy burn native versus wrapped branch switch at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public bridge-side burn path behind `MINTER_ROLE` but used by outbound bridge flows` with boundary-controlled inputs covering zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and make `evm/src/eNear/contracts/ENearProxy.sol::burn` violate `legacy outbound burns must not let attackers create Near-side withdrawal claims without consuming the exact on-chain eNEAR balance once` in the `native versus wrapped branch switch` attack class because calls `eNear.transferToNear` after asserting the token address is the configured eNEAR token becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/eNear/contracts/ENearProxy.sol::burn`
- Entrypoint: `public bridge-side burn path behind `MINTER_ROLE` but used by outbound bridge flows`
- Attacker controls: token address and amount
- Exploit idea: Target zero-address, deployed-token, custom-minter, native-vault, or bridge-token branch predicates. Concentrate on zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values.
- Invariant to test: legacy outbound burns must not let attackers create Near-side withdrawal claims without consuming the exact on-chain eNEAR balance once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each branch predicate to flip around callbacks or mapping writes and assert that the same source asset can never produce two incompatible custody models. Sweep boundary values for zero, maximal, and malformed user-controlled values and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
