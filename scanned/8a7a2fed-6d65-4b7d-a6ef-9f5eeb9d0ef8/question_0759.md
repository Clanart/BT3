# Q0759: check_shop_domain: A `shop` param used by `shop_login`'s `URI.encode_www_form` wit...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `shop` param and `host`/`embedded` params) reach `check_shop_domain / current_shopify_domain / installed_shop_session` in app/controllers/concerns/shopify_app/ensure_installed.rb via GET any EnsureInstalled controller action, supplying a `shop` param used by `shop_login`'s `URI.encode_www_form` with attacker `host`/`return_to`, so that the loaded installed shop session must correspond to the merchant proven to control the shop, not a raw param is violated, leading to cross-shop access: loading/acting with another store's offline session? Specifically confirm that the derived shop/user/signature equals the canonical Shopify-asserted value for every input.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/concerns/shopify_app/ensure_installed.rb — `check_shop_domain / current_shopify_domain / installed_shop_session`
- Entrypoint: GET any EnsureInstalled controller action
- Attacker controls: the `shop` param and `host`/`embedded` params — specifically a `shop` param used by `shop_login`'s `URI.encode_www_form` with attacker `host`/`return_to`.
- Exploit idea: Compare the value the gem derives from the attacker input against the value Shopify actually signed/asserted.
- Invariant to test: the loaded installed shop session must correspond to the merchant proven to control the shop, not a raw param
- Expected Immunefi impact: cross-shop access: loading/acting with another store's offline session (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: differential test: feed the crafted input to the parsing/verification method and diff derived vs. canonical shop/user/signature.
