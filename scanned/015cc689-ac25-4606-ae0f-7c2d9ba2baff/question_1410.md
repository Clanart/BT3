# Q1410: withdraw fee-payer unlock split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `withdraw` by submit transactions invoking writable-account instructions with lamport amounts, account ownership transitions, cpi ordering, and close/reopen patterns such that fee-payer lock or unlock handling may diverge from the accounts actually charged later, breaking the invariant that fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::withdraw
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking writable-account instructions
- Attacker controls: lamport amounts, account ownership transitions, CPI ordering, and close/reopen patterns
- Exploit idea: try to free or relock the fee payer at the wrong moment
- Invariant to test: fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace fee-payer lock state across retries, conflicts, and partial failures
