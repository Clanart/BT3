# Q1349: store_account_and_update_capitalization program-deployment race

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `store_account_and_update_capitalization` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with transactions that create, close, resize, or rewrite many accounts in one batch such that loader state and runtime state can disagree about whether a program version is executable when this function runs, breaking the invariant that program executability must be consistent across loader and runtime checks and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::store_account_and_update_capitalization
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: transactions that create, close, resize, or rewrite many accounts in one batch
- Exploit idea: look for invocation windows around deploy/upgrade/close boundaries
- Invariant to test: program executability must be consistent across loader and runtime checks
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race upgrade/close transactions against repeated invocation of the same program id
