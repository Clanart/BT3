# Q3436: Solana used nonces bucket size storage withdrawal escapes live liabilities via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public finalize instructions through nonce bucketing` and then replay or reorder the earlier source-chain event or later forwarded bridge leg so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/constants.rs and used_nonces.rs` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `storage withdrawal escapes live liabilities` under splits used nonces into fixed-size accounts and computes rent based on the highest seen nonce, violating `bucket arithmetic must not let extreme nonce values escape replay protection or corrupt rent compensation across adjacent buckets`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/constants.rs and used_nonces.rs`
- Entrypoint: `public finalize instructions through nonce bucketing`
- Attacker controls: very large destination nonces and the boundary between used-nonce PDAs
- Exploit idea: Look for withdrawals and unregister paths that do not fully account for pending, finalized, or fast-transfer records. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: bucket arithmetic must not let extreme nonce values escape replay protection or corrupt rent compensation across adjacent buckets
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Open live bridge state, withdraw aggressively, and assert that storage balances cannot fall below the reserved amount implied by that live state. Then replay or reorder the earlier source-chain event or later forwarded bridge leg and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
