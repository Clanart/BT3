# Q2496: HookedStateDB.SetCode - Debug Trace With State Overrides Clears Real Delegation

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker request debug_trace* for crafted included transactions or calls through `debug/trace hooked EIP-7702 or CREATE code mutation` while controlling `trace config` and `state overrides`, under the precondition that a Cronos-controlled operational path consumes trace output, drive `debug_trace* -> predecessor replay -> ApplyMessageWithConfig in trace context -> result marshaling` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb_hooked.go::HookedStateDB.SetCode` so that debug trace with state overrides clears real delegation, violating the invariant that debug tracing must not mutate committed state or produce a false state used for fund movement, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb_hooked.go::HookedStateDB.SetCode`
- Entrypoint: `debug/trace hooked EIP-7702 or CREATE code mutation`
- Attacker controls: `trace config`, `state overrides`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: debug trace with state overrides clears real delegation through `debug_trace* -> predecessor replay -> ApplyMessageWithConfig in trace context -> result marshaling`.
- Invariant to test: debug tracing must not mutate committed state or produce a false state used for fund movement.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: construct a contract harness that performs nested CALL/CREATE/SELFDESTRUCT/revert and compare bank keeper balances with StateDB balances.
