# Q2147: Substitute a wrong proof path into journal_hash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker substitute part of attacker-controlled the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof so `journal_hash` accepts a proof, header, or path that should have been rejected, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/mod.rs::journal_hash
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Exploit idea: swap part of attacker-controlled the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof while keeping the rest seemingly valid
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
