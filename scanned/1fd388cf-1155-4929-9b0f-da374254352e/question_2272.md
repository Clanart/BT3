# Q2272: Confuse replacement linkage in insert_signed_emergency_stop_tx_if_not_exists

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit` so `insert_signed_emergency_stop_tx_if_not_exists` confuses replacement and non-replacement contexts, causing the nofn aggregate key and covenant context to inherit the wrong history and violating the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/aggregator.rs::insert_signed_emergency_stop_tx_if_not_exists
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the `evm_address` in `BaseDeposit`
- Exploit idea: make replacement and non-replacement data bleed across one trusted path
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Bugs with Clementine presigning, causing failure of operator’s reimbursements failed
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
