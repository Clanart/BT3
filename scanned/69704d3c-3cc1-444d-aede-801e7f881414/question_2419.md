# Q2419: remove_unrooted_slots stale cache replay

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove_unrooted_slots` by submit transactions across fast fork churn and then query recent state with many-account write bursts, slot churn, and recent-state queries so that stale cached account content can outlive the storage or bank state that later logic expects, breaking the invariant that caches must not serve account data from an impossible slot/state combination and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::remove_unrooted_slots
- Entrypoint: submit transactions across fast fork churn and then query recent state
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts, slot churn, and recent-state queries
- Exploit idea: read an impossible old value after the canonical state has changed
- Invariant to test: caches must not serve account data from an impossible slot/state combination
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race rewrites and immediate reads, then diff cache-derived results against storage and bank views
