# Q1973: drain_modified_entries sysvar snapshot drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `drain_modified_entries` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs around upgrade/close churn with upgrade timing, close/reopen timing, and repeated invocation of the same program id such that clock, rent, blockhash, or slot-hash values observed here can drift relative to the state later committed, breaking the invariant that a transaction should observe one coherent sysvar snapshot for its admitted execution context and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/loaded_programs.rs::drain_modified_entries
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs around upgrade/close churn
- Attacker controls: upgrade timing, close/reopen timing, and repeated invocation of the same program id
- Exploit idea: search for split sysvar snapshots across one processing lifecycle
- Invariant to test: a transaction should observe one coherent sysvar snapshot for its admitted execution context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace sysvar values at admission, execution, and commit
