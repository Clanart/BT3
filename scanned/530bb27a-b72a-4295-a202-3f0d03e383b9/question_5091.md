# Q5091: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - _minimumLiquidity is caller-supplied on the deposit leg

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: deposit() and depositNative() forward the caller's _minimumLiquidity into the Wombat deposit, so a caller can accept a deposit that mints far less LP than fair while the receipt mint is taken from the resulting delta. Under the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, is there an unprivileged sequence of `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` that leaves `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` unreconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, violates the invariant that a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded, and delivers Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: _minimumLiquidity is caller-supplied on the deposit leg)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: deposit() and depositNative() forward the caller's _minimumLiquidity into the Wombat deposit, so a caller can accept a deposit that mints far less LP than fair while the receipt mint is taken from the resulting delta. Precondition: the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling.
- Invariant to test: a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, snapshot `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`, run the attacker's `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
