# Q2592: interest-rate via redeem: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `redeem` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `interest-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
