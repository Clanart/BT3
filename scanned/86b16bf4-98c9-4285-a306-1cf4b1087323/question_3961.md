# Q3961: interest-rate via liquidate-redeem: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, drive `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) — which interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization — to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, then read `interest-rate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
