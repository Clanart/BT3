# Q0988: interest-rate via borrow: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the future mask produced by the new debt bit reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `borrow` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
