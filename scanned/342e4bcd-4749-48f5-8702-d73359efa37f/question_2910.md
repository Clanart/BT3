# Q2910: merge-price via liquidate-multi: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling the trait principals supplied per entry, can an unprivileged attacker make `merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the trait principals supplied per entry across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `merge-price` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
