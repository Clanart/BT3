# Q1356: load_program nonce replay window

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_program` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with program deployment/upgrade timing, cpi invocation patterns, and versioned message layouts such that durable nonce or recent-blockhash state can be observed one way here and a different way later in the same submission lifecycle, breaking the invariant that nonce and blockhash freshness checks must be stable across the full processing pipeline and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::load_program
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: program deployment/upgrade timing, CPI invocation patterns, and versioned message layouts
- Exploit idea: find a same-slot or retry-driven way to reuse a nonce or stale blockhash window
- Invariant to test: nonce and blockhash freshness checks must be stable across the full processing pipeline
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: replay durable-nonce and edge-age blockhash transactions across retries and batches
