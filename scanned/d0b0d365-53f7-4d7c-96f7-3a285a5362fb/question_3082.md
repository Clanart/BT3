# Q3082: notify_watchers premature frozen-slot assumption

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_watchers` by trigger many hot notifications from one subscription shape with subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams so that this path can treat a slot as finalized for one purpose before all related account state is safely written, breaking the invariant that frozen-slot assumptions must not outpace actual durable state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_watchers
- Entrypoint: trigger many hot notifications from one subscription shape
- Attacker controls: subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams
- Exploit idea: search for early frozen assumptions
- Invariant to test: frozen-slot assumptions must not outpace actual durable state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: trace slot-freeze transitions and storage durability
