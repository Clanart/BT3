# Q2622: next-index via call-ststx-ratio: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `next-index` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
