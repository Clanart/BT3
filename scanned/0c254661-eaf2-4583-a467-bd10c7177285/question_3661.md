# Q3661: NEAR omni-types EVM header parser length or offset shift reinterprets adjacent fields at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public EVM proof path through `verify_proof`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-types/src/evm/header.rs::BlockHeader` violate `header parsing must not accept malformed or cross-fork data that still drives a valid-looking receipt proof toward bridge settlement` in the `length or offset shift reinterprets adjacent fields` attack class because decodes block headers that underpin receipt-proof verification becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-types/src/evm/header.rs::BlockHeader`
- Entrypoint: `public EVM proof path through `verify_proof``
- Attacker controls: RLP-encoded header bytes and all decoded header fields including receipts root and hash presence
- Exploit idea: Target VAA body offsets, byte slicing helpers, RLP decoders, and Borsh length prefixes. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: header parsing must not accept malformed or cross-fork data that still drives a valid-looking receipt proof toward bridge settlement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Light client verification bypass
- Fast validation: Fuzz underlong, overlong, and near-boundary payloads and assert that accepted bytes decode to exactly one structured message. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
