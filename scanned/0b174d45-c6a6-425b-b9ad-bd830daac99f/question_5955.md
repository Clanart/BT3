# Q5955: WombatBribeManager.vote - getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown

## Question
In wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Starting from a state where a keeper castVotes transaction is pending in the mempool, can an unprivileged EOA use `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` to leave `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]` inconsistent with `IBribeRewardPool(pool.rewarder).balanceOf(user)`, violating the invariant that the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance and extracting Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` (mechanism: getUserVotable ignores balances in cooldown)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: every lp address and every signed delta, including duplicates and offsetting positive and negative entries
- Exploit idea: getUserVotable() returns IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(_user), which excludes cooldown slots, so the ceiling shifts whenever the user starts or cancels a cooldown, and cancelUnlock raises it with no revalidation of existing votes. Precondition: a keeper castVotes transaction is pending in the mempool.
- Invariant to test: the voting ceiling and the votes already cast must be reconciled on every change to the locked balance; concretely, `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]` must stay reconciled with `IBribeRewardPool(pool.rewarder).balanceOf(user)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `vote(address[] _lps, int256[] _deltas)` sequence atomically under a keeper castVotes transaction is pending in the mempool, asserting at the end that `userVotedForPoolInVlmgp[user][lp]` still equals `IBribeRewardPool(pool.rewarder).balanceOf(user)` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
