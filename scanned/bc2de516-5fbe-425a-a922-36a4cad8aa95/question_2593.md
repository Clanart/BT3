# Q2593: Duplicate queue or processing state in verify_proof

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `verify_proof` twice with attacker-controlled multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove context treated as canonical for a deposit and violating the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/header_chain/mmr_native.rs::verify_proof
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via multiple kickoff/challenge/assert/disprove transactions referencing the same deposit context
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
