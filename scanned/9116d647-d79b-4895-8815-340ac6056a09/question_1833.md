# Q1833: NEAR claim_fee entry asset-branch confusion on finalization at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public `claim_fee` proof-submission flow` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee` violate `fee claims must remain uniquely bound to one already-finalized destination event and one authentic fee recipient` in the `asset-branch confusion on finalization` attack class because verifies a `FinTransfer` proof and forwards the predecessor account into `claim_fee_callback` for fee release becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee`
- Entrypoint: `public `claim_fee` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and caller identity as purported fee recipient
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: fee claims must remain uniquely bound to one already-finalized destination event and one authentic fee recipient
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
