# Q2899: resolve-ztoken via collateral-add: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`resolve-ztoken` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343) reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:343` -> `resolve-ztoken`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `resolve-ztoken` reads `lindex` from the market's own `index-cache` via `get-cached-indexes`, not from the vault, then multiplies the price and divides by INDEX-PRECISION. Reach it through `collateral-add` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, then read `resolve-ztoken` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
