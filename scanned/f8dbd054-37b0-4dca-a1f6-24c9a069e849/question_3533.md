# Q3533: Drive state split inside verify_merkle_proof

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation with crafted reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height so `verify_merkle_proof` updates one canonical value while another subsystem retains the older one for the same event, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/merkle_tree.rs::verify_merkle_proof
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: update one canonical value while another subsystem keeps the old one for the same event via reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
