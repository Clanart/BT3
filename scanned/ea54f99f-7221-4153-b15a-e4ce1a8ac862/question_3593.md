# Q3593: store: A domain with trailing dot / port that stores under a distinct ...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `shopify_domain` used as the unique key and its casing) reach `store / retrieve_by_shopify_domain / construct_session` in lib/shopify_app/session/shop_session_storage.rb via any store/retrieve triggered by callback save_session or token exchange, supplying a domain with trailing dot / port that stores under a distinct key but is looked up under another, so that one shop row must map to exactly one canonical domain; lookup and uniqueness must agree is violated, leading to cross-shop token retrieval (access-token theft) via key normalization mismatch? Specifically confirm that the strongest verified identity source wins; a weaker channel cannot override it.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/session/shop_session_storage.rb — `store / retrieve_by_shopify_domain / construct_session`
- Entrypoint: any store/retrieve triggered by callback save_session or token exchange
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_domain` used as the unique key and its casing — specifically a domain with trailing dot / port that stores under a distinct key but is looked up under another.
- Exploit idea: Send the identity/token via the unexpected channel (URL param vs Authorization header vs cookie) and compare handling.
- Invariant to test: one shop row must map to exactly one canonical domain; lookup and uniqueness must agree
- Expected Immunefi impact: cross-shop token retrieval (access-token theft) via key normalization mismatch (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: test asserting header, URL-param, and cookie sources cannot be mixed to supply a weaker/attacker token.
