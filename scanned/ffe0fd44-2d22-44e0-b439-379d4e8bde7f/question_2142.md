# Q2142: spawn_simple_qos_server serialization aliasing

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `spawn_simple_qos_server` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one client with connection counts, packet pacing, payload sizes, and source-ip churn timing such that account memory serialization or deserialization can alias overlapping regions and write back inconsistent data, breaking the invariant that one logical account backing store must not be interpreted as two independent writable regions and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/quic.rs::spawn_simple_qos_server
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one client
- Attacker controls: connection counts, packet pacing, payload sizes, and source-IP churn timing
- Exploit idea: target duplicate accounts, reallocs, and nested CPIs that touch the same backing data twice
- Invariant to test: one logical account backing store must not be interpreted as two independent writable regions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace serialized and deserialized memory regions for duplicated writable accounts
