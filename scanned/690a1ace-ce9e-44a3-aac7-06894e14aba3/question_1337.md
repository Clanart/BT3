# Q1337: NEAR ft_on_transfer dispatcher fee and principal split divergence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `NEAR NEP-141 `ft_on_transfer` callback into bridge dispatch` with crafted amount, fee, or native-fee inputs and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::ft_on_transfer` use inconsistent fee and principal values across dispatches untrusted `BridgeOnTransferMsg` into `init_transfer`, `fast_fin_transfer`, `utxo_fin_transfer`, or `swap_migrated_token` and explicitly trusts `env::signer_account_id()` instead of `sender_id` for storage payment decisions, violating `the chosen branch, payer identity, amount, and downstream transfer type must stay aligned so one callback cannot burn, lock, or settle value on the wrong path`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::ft_on_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `NEAR NEP-141 `ft_on_transfer` callback into bridge dispatch`
- Attacker controls: token contract choice, `sender_id`, `signer_id`, amount, JSON `msg` variant, recipient, fee, native fee, `external_id`, fast-transfer payloads, and UTXO payloads
- Exploit idea: Focus on branches where fee checks happen before normalization, denormalization, callback resolution, or storage billing.
- Invariant to test: the chosen branch, payer identity, amount, and downstream transfer type must stay aligned so one callback cannot burn, lock, or settle value on the wrong path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Fuzz amount/fee/native-fee edge cases around zero, max, and decimal boundaries and assert that emitted value plus stored fee always equals consumed value.
