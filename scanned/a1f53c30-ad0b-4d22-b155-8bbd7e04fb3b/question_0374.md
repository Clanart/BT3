# Q0374: BaseRewardPool.donateRewards - totalStaked and balanceOf read from different sources

## Question
In rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol, totalStaked() reads IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(operator) while balanceOf(account) reads IMasterMagpie(operator).stakingInfo(stakingToken, account), so a token sent directly to MasterMagpie, or a vlMGP-style credit made with no transfer, permanently desynchronises numerator and denominator. Starting from a state where the pool has exactly one registered reward token and no queued backlog, can an unprivileged EOA use `donateRewards(uint256 _amountReward, address _rewardToken)` to leave `10**stakingDecimals()` inconsistent with `totalStaked()`, violating the invariant that sum over all accounts of balanceOf(account) must equal totalStaked() and extracting Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol -> `donateRewards(uint256 _amountReward, address _rewardToken)` (mechanism: totalStaked and balanceOf read from different sources)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `donateRewards(uint256 _amountReward, address _rewardToken)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountReward down to one wei and which registered reward token is provisioned
- Exploit idea: totalStaked() reads IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(operator) while balanceOf(account) reads IMasterMagpie(operator).stakingInfo(stakingToken, account), so a token sent directly to MasterMagpie, or a vlMGP-style credit made with no transfer, permanently desynchronises numerator and denominator. Precondition: the pool has exactly one registered reward token and no queued backlog.
- Invariant to test: sum over all accounts of balanceOf(account) must equal totalStaked(); concretely, `10**stakingDecimals()` must stay reconciled with `totalStaked()`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the pool has exactly one registered reward token and no queued backlog, snapshot `10**stakingDecimals()` and `totalStaked()`, run the attacker's `donateRewards(uint256 _amountReward, address _rewardToken)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
