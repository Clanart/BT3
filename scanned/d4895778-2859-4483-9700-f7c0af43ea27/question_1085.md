# Q1085: Solana init_transfer_sol burn or lock before irreversible state through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public Solana `init_transfer_sol` instruction` with control over payer lamports, recipient string, amount, fee, native fee, and message and desynchronize `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_sol` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `burn or lock before irreversible state` attack class because handles outbound native-SOL bridging while still posting the same class of Near-bound transfer payload, violating `native-SOL outbound flows must not emit claims whose amount or fee exceeds the value actually escrowing or burning on Solana`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_sol`
- Entrypoint: `public Solana `init_transfer_sol` instruction`
- Attacker controls: payer lamports, recipient string, amount, fee, native fee, and message
- Exploit idea: Look for branches where custody changes happen before the final pending-state, mapping, or callback outcome is fixed. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: native-SOL outbound flows must not emit claims whose amount or fee exceeds the value actually escrowing or burning on Solana
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Model failures between custody changes and state writes, then assert that no branch both consumes user value and allows the transfer to be replayed or dropped. Also assert cross-module consistency between `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_sol` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
