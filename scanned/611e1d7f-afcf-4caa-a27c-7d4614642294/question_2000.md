# Q2000: increment via transfer: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury reach `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it advances the user-id nonce, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `transfer` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `transfer` twice with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury varied, and assert that the value `increment` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
