# Q2126: Substitute a wrong proof path into verify_bridge_circuit

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker substitute part of attacker-controlled the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering so `verify_bridge_circuit` accepts a proof, header, or path that should have been rejected, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and breaking the invariant that kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/structs.rs::verify_bridge_circuit
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering
- Exploit idea: swap part of attacker-controlled the block/merkle proof nodes, indices, and ordering while keeping the rest seemingly valid
- Invariant to test: kickoff/challenge/disprove handling must never let one deposit context inherit another deposit's proof or watchtower state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
