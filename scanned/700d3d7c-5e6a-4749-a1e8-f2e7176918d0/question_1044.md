# Q1044: Airdrop2.claim - initial five percent is added on every evaluation

## Question
Note that in rewards/Airdrop2.sol, vested is computed as (totalAmount * 5 / 100) plus the linear term on every call rather than being tracked as a one-time release, so the interaction between the fixed component and the running claimed counter decides whether the first tranche can be taken more than once. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)` under the elapsed period count has already exceeded vestingPeriodCount and force `vested computed in _getClaimable` apart from `claimedAmount[account]`, breaking the invariant that a one-time initial release must be recorded as released, not recomputed on every claim for Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/Airdrop2.sol -> `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)` (mechanism: initial five percent is added on every evaluation)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `claim(uint256 totalAmount, bytes32[] merkleProof, bool isLock)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: totalAmount and merkleProof for any leaf that verifies against the root, plus isLock and the claim timing
- Exploit idea: vested is computed as (totalAmount * 5 / 100) plus the linear term on every call rather than being tracked as a one-time release, so the interaction between the fixed component and the running claimed counter decides whether the first tranche can be taken more than once. Precondition: the elapsed period count has already exceeded vestingPeriodCount.
- Invariant to test: a one-time initial release must be recorded as released, not recomputed on every claim; concretely, `vested computed in _getClaimable` must stay reconciled with `claimedAmount[account]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (totalAmount and merkleProof for any leaf that verifies against the root, plus isLock and the claim timing) under the elapsed period count has already exceeded vestingPeriodCount, asserting on every row that a one-time initial release must be recorded as released, not recomputed on every claim.
