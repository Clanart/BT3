# Q4761: uint-to-list-u64 via borrow: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling `amount`, drive `uint-to-list-u64` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80) — which expands a bitmap into a 64-element list — to normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:80` -> `uint-to-list-u64`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `uint-to-list-u64` expands a bitmap into a 64-element list. Reach it through `borrow` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `uint-to-list-u64` touches, run `borrow` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
