# Q3264: StateDB.AddBalance - Trace Hook Reports Balance Change That Differs From Bank State

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker execute a contract that moves EVM-denom value through nested calls through `EVM balance credit from CALL, SELFDESTRUCT, reward, or refund` while controlling `storage dirty keys` and `cache context depth`, under the precondition that a contract performs nested value transfers and SELFDESTRUCT, drive `StateDB.Commit -> conflict check -> native cache flush -> account deletion/balance burn` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.AddBalance` so that trace hook reports balance change that differs from bank state, violating the invariant that SELFDESTRUCT must not leave withdrawable balances in deleted accounts, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.AddBalance`
- Entrypoint: `EVM balance credit from CALL, SELFDESTRUCT, reward, or refund`
- Attacker controls: `storage dirty keys`, `cache context depth`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: trace hook reports balance change that differs from bank state through `StateDB.Commit -> conflict check -> native cache flush -> account deletion/balance burn`.
- Invariant to test: SELFDESTRUCT must not leave withdrawable balances in deleted accounts.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: force the edge value at uint64/uint256/sdk.Int boundaries and assert no smaller debit, larger refund, or supply change occurs.
