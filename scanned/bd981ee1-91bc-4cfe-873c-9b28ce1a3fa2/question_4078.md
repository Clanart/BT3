# Q4078: calc-cumulative-debt via collateral-remove-redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `min-underlying`, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-cumulative-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:180` -> `calc-cumulative-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `calc-cumulative-debt` multiplies scaled principal by an index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `min-underlying`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
