# Q5314: refresh via collateral-remove-redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
