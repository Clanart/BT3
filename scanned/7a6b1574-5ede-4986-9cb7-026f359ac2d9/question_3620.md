# Q3620: NEAR Wormhole prover verify_vaa_callback signature malleability or alternate recovery at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `callback after external Wormhole verification` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/lib.rs::verify_vaa_callback` violate `callback parsing must never let an attacker swap message class, emitter identity, or payload fields after external validity has already been accepted` in the `signature malleability or alternate recovery` attack class because decodes hex, parses the VAA structure, checks that the first payload byte matches the expected proof kind, and converts it into a typed `ProverResult` becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-prover/wormhole-omni-prover-proxy/src/lib.rs::verify_vaa_callback`
- Entrypoint: `callback after external Wormhole verification`
- Attacker controls: proof kind, VAA bytes, callback success/failure, and local payload parsing
- Exploit idea: Target `v/r/s` normalization, ECDSA recovery semantics, and Ethereum-style signature handling on non-Ethereum chains. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: callback parsing must never let an attacker swap message class, emitter identity, or payload fields after external validity has already been accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cryptographic flaws
- Fast validation: Try low-s/high-s and alternate-`v` forms and assert that recovery either rejects them or yields one unique signer and one unique message. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
