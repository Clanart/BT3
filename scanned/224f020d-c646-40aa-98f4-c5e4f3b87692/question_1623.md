# Q1623: safe_embedded_app_url: No `host` but a `shop`, so `Base64.encode64("#{sanitized_shop_n...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the base64 `host` param, or the `shop` param used to synthesize host) reach `safe_embedded_app_url / deduced_phishing_attack? / unsafe_embedded_host?` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/embedded_app.rb via GET a page that redirects to the embedded admin (invalid-token path, ensure_installed), supplying no `host` but a `shop`, so `Base64.encode64("#{sanitized_shop_name}/admin")` builds the host from the shop param, so that phishing-host detection must reject any non-trusted authority including userinfo tricks is violated, leading to phishing redirect / OAuth-parameter leak? Specifically confirm that the activated session binds to the verified token's shop/user, never a disagreeing cookie/param.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/embedded_app.rb — `safe_embedded_app_url / deduced_phishing_attack? / unsafe_embedded_host?`
- Entrypoint: GET a page that redirects to the embedded admin (invalid-token path, ensure_installed)
- Attacker controls: the base64 `host` param, or the `shop` param used to synthesize host — specifically no `host` but a `shop`, so `Base64.encode64("#{sanitized_shop_name}/admin")` builds the host from the shop param.
- Exploit idea: Present a cookie and a token that disagree on shop/user and confirm the verified token wins, not the cookie.
- Invariant to test: phishing-host detection must reject any non-trusted authority including userinfo tricks
- Expected Immunefi impact: phishing redirect / OAuth-parameter leak (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: test with a mismatched cookie/token pair asserting the session binds to the verified token's shop/user only.
