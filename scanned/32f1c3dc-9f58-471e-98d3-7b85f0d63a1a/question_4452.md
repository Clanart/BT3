# Q4452: BaseRewardPool.updateFor - _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles

## Question
rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol - _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted, under the reward token charges a transfer fee so the received balance is below the requested amount, exploit this through `updateFor(address _account)` to break the reconciliation between `totalStaked()` and `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(operator)` and the invariant that a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered, yielding High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol -> `updateFor(address _account)` (mechanism: _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `updateFor(address _account)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Precondition: the reward token charges a transfer fee so the received balance is below the requested amount.
- Invariant to test: a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered; concretely, `totalStaked()` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(operator)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the reward token charges a transfer fee so the received balance is below the requested amount, then assert `totalStaked()` and `IERC20(stakingToken).balanceOf(operator)` end identical in both runs.
