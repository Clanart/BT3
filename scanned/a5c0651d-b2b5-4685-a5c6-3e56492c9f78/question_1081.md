# Q1081: EVM Wormhole initTransferExtension recipient or message ambiguity through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public outbound flow through `initTransfer` on Wormhole-backed chains` with control over msg.value passed as `value`, current `wormholeNonce`, sender, token address, origin nonce, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, and message and desynchronize `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::initTransferExtension` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `recipient or message ambiguity` attack class because serializes a Wormhole `InitTransfer` payload and publishes it using the current nonce and supplied value, violating `outbound message publication must remain one-to-one with consumed assets and must not diverge under underpayment, overpayment, or callback/retry edge cases`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::initTransferExtension`
- Entrypoint: `public outbound flow through `initTransfer` on Wormhole-backed chains`
- Attacker controls: msg.value passed as `value`, current `wormholeNonce`, sender, token address, origin nonce, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, and message
- Exploit idea: Exploit non-canonical string, ByteArray, hex, or account-id forms to make one source-side intent resolve to a different destination-side recipient or message. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: outbound message publication must remain one-to-one with consumed assets and must not diverge under underpayment, overpayment, or callback/retry edge cases
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Cross-check source-side serialization against every downstream parser and assert that equivalent-looking inputs cannot resolve to distinct destination accounts or app messages. Also assert cross-module consistency between `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::initTransferExtension` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
