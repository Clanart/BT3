# Q3253: hash collapse distinct inputs into one accepted state via duplicate public-key/message pairs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit aggregate signature material targeting `hash` in `crates/chia-bls/src/gtelement.rs` with duplicate public-key/message pairs when a node processes data from an untrusted peer or wallet make chia_rs collapse distinct inputs into one accepted state, violating the invariant that domain-separated signed messages cannot be replayed, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Consensus-valid spend, block generator, proof, or block record path can mint, burn, steal, double-spend, or mis-account Chia coins/rewards/fees?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-bls/src/gtelement.rs:59` / `hash`
- Entrypoint: submit aggregate signature material
- Attacker controls: duplicate public-key/message pairs
- Exploit idea: Drive `hash` through its public caller path using duplicate public-key/message pairs; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: domain-separated signed messages cannot be replayed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Consensus-valid spend, block generator, proof, or block record path can mint, burn, steal, double-spend, or mis-account Chia coins/rewards/fees
- Fast validation: construct aggregate signature vectors with duplicates, infinity, and swapped messages.
