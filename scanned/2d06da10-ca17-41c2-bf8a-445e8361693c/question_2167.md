# Q2167: handle_forwarded_packets fee-charge mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `handle_forwarded_packets` by submit transactions that legitimately enter the forwarding path with payload sizes, duplicate packets, versioned messages, and boundary forwarding timing such that fee-payer debiting or fee calculation can diverge from the execution result that this function eventually commits or reports, breaking the invariant that fees charged, reported, and committed must match one another and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/fetch_stage.rs::handle_forwarded_packets
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that legitimately enter the forwarding path
- Attacker controls: payload sizes, duplicate packets, versioned messages, and boundary forwarding timing
- Exploit idea: create an execution that undercharges or misattributes fees relative to actual work
- Invariant to test: fees charged, reported, and committed must match one another
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: compare declared fees, charged lamports, and committed fee counters
