# Q2538: Solana finalize_transfer nonce bitmap shared proof response reused across entrypoints at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public inbound Solana flow through `finalize_transfer` and `finalize_transfer_sol`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs plus finalize instruction` violate `cross-PDA nonce accounting must not let a replay land in an uninitialized bucket or refund reserve lamports while keeping the nonce marked unused` in the `shared proof response reused across entrypoints` attack class because buckets destination nonces into multiple PDAs and compensates rent as the highest observed nonce advances becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs plus finalize instruction`
- Entrypoint: `public inbound Solana flow through `finalize_transfer` and `finalize_transfer_sol``
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, PDA bucket index, payer rent, and initialization order
- Exploit idea: Attack systems where one verifier contract serves deploy, finalize, metadata, and fee-claim flows with a shared result type. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: cross-PDA nonce accounting must not let a replay land in an uninitialized bucket or refund reserve lamports while keeping the nonce marked unused
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Attempt to route accepted verifier outputs into every public proof consumer and assert that each entrypoint only accepts its intended result variant and source semantics. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
