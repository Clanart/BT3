# Q4072: get-cached-indexes via collateral-remove-redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
