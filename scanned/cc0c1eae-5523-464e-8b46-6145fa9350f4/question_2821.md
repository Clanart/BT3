# Q2821: remove_slots_le zero-lamport resurrection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `remove_slots_le` by submit transactions that churn the same pubkeys across old and new slots with same-pubkey churn across slots plus cleanup pressure so that dead or zero-lamport accounts can survive or reappear because cleanup and load paths disagree, breaking the invariant that closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::remove_slots_le
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that churn the same pubkeys across old and new slots
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey churn across slots plus cleanup pressure
- Exploit idea: look for stale dead-account visibility after close/recreate churn
- Invariant to test: closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: close and recreate the same attacker-controlled account shape repeatedly
