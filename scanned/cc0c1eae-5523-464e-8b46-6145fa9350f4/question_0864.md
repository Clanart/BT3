# Q864: resanitize_transaction_minimally balance prepost mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `resanitize_transaction_minimally` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction`, `simulatetransaction`, or direct tpu quic with versioned messages, address lookup tables, duplicated accounts, and boundary serialization forms such that balance collection or reporting can disagree with the actual state transition that commits, breaking the invariant that reported balances must match committed balances and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::resanitize_transaction_minimally
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction`, `simulateTransaction`, or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, address lookup tables, duplicated accounts, and boundary serialization forms
- Exploit idea: look for mismatches between reported and real lamport deltas
- Invariant to test: reported balances must match committed balances
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: compare pre/post balances returned by tracing against a direct account diff
