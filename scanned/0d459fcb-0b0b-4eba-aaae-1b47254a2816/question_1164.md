# Q1164: NEAR callback gas budgeting resume-path replay or duplication through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public finalization and fast-transfer flows with user-controlled `msg`` with control over message length, gas left at call time, and whether the path chooses `ft_transfer` or `ft_transfer_call` and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens gas splitting plus callback consumers` from the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `resume-path replay or duplication` attack class because computes `ft_transfer_call` gas from prepaid minus used gas and falls back to strict minimum checks before minting or transferring, violating `callback gas budgeting must not let attacker-controlled message size or branching force a partial economic effect before the contract can safely resolve the outcome`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens gas splitting plus callback consumers`
- Entrypoint: `public finalization and fast-transfer flows with user-controlled `msg``
- Attacker controls: message length, gas left at call time, and whether the path chooses `ft_transfer` or `ft_transfer_call`
- Exploit idea: Abuse yield/resume or asynchronous callback timing so the same pending outbound transfer is restarted after it already progressed. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting.
- Invariant to test: callback gas budgeting must not let attacker-controlled message size or branching force a partial economic effect before the contract can safely resolve the outcome
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trigger timeouts, duplicate funding, and repeated callback delivery and assert that the resumed transfer either progresses once or cleanly fails once. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens gas splitting plus callback consumers` and the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting after every branch.
