# Q2038: Backend.TraceBlock - Decoded Tx Count Differs From Trace Result Count

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker request debug_trace* for crafted included transactions or calls through `debug_traceBlock over public JSON-RPC` while controlling `transaction index` and `trace config`, under the precondition that a Cronos-controlled operational path consumes trace output, drive `TraceCall/TraceBlock -> block context setup -> hooked StateDB execution` in `rpc/backend/tracing.go::Backend.TraceBlock` so that decoded tx count differs from trace result count, violating the invariant that debug tracing must not mutate committed state or produce a false state used for fund movement, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/backend/tracing.go::Backend.TraceBlock`
- Entrypoint: `debug_traceBlock over public JSON-RPC`
- Attacker controls: `transaction index`, `trace config`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: decoded tx count differs from trace result count through `TraceCall/TraceBlock -> block context setup -> hooked StateDB execution`.
- Invariant to test: debug tracing must not mutate committed state or produce a false state used for fund movement.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: construct a contract harness that performs nested CALL/CREATE/SELFDESTRUCT/revert and compare bank keeper balances with StateDB balances.
