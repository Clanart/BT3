# Q1046: resolve-or-create via liquidate-redeem: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names, so the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the vault whose share price the redemption moves varied, and assert that the value `resolve-or-create` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
