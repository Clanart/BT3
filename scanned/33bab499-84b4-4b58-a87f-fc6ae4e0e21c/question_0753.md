# Q753: Misbind storage-proof semantics in get_storage_proof

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges so `get_storage_proof` treats one storage slot, value, or path as proving another, corrupting the linkage between Citrea state and a replacement deposit move transaction and violating the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/citrea.rs::get_storage_proof
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges
- Exploit idea: treat one storage slot/value/path as if it proved another using the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
