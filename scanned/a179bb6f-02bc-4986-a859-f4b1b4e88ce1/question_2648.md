# Q2648: mWomSV.startUnlock - matured slot decays the rewardable percent toward zero

## Question
In wombat/mWomSV.sol, for a slot past endTime the percent contribution is amountInCoolDown * 1e18 * (endTime - startTime) / userTotalVlmgp / (timeNow - startTime), which decays without a floor, so delay alone confiscates a user's whole vesting entitlement. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `startUnlock(uint256 _amountToCoolDown)` while a large mWOM bonus distribution has just been queued into mWOMSVBaseRewarder, and drive `totalAmount` out of agreement with `IERC20(mWOM).balanceOf(address(this))` - breaking the invariant that a user must not lose vested value merely because they redeemed late - for High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWomSV.sol -> `startUnlock(uint256 _amountToCoolDown)` (mechanism: matured slot decays the rewardable percent toward zero)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `startUnlock(uint256 _amountToCoolDown)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amountToCoolDown and the timestamps written into the slot
- Exploit idea: for a slot past endTime the percent contribution is amountInCoolDown * 1e18 * (endTime - startTime) / userTotalVlmgp / (timeNow - startTime), which decays without a floor, so delay alone confiscates a user's whole vesting entitlement. Precondition: a large mWOM bonus distribution has just been queued into mWOMSVBaseRewarder.
- Invariant to test: a user must not lose vested value merely because they redeemed late; concretely, `totalAmount` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(mWOM).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amountToCoolDown and the timestamps written into the slot) under a large mWOM bonus distribution has just been queued into mWOMSVBaseRewarder, asserting on every row that a user must not lose vested value merely because they redeemed late.
