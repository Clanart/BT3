# Q1185: NEAR claim_fee callback recipient or fee-recipient rebinding at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `proof callback reached from public `claim_fee`` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee_callback` violate `claiming fees must never let a caller delete the pending record, collect twice, or collect against a destination event that does not match the stored origin transfer` in the `recipient or fee-recipient rebinding` attack class because removes the stored transfer, enforces fee-recipient equality, reconciles fast-transfer state, denormalizes the amount from the destination event, computes fee including any documented dust, and sends the fee becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::claim_fee_callback`
- Entrypoint: `proof callback reached from public `claim_fee``
- Attacker controls: decoded `FinTransfer` result, predecessor account, pending transfer record, origin transfer id for fast paths, and token decimals
- Exploit idea: Exploit optional fee-recipient fields, fast-transfer relayer substitution, or predecessor-captured identities. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: claiming fees must never let a caller delete the pending record, collect twice, or collect against a destination event that does not match the stored origin transfer
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Build pairs of proofs/messages that vary only in recipient-oriented fields and assert that settlement, fee claim, and event emission stay bound to one tuple. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
