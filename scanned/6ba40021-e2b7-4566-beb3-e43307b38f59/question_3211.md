# Q3211: filter_logs_results notification filter overload

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_logs_results` by use in-scope logs subscriptions with legal filters with logs filters, encodings, and log-heavy transactions so that attacker-chosen notification filters force more post-filter work than the subscriber semantics imply, breaking the invariant that notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_logs_results
- Entrypoint: use in-scope logs subscriptions with legal filters
- Attacker controls: logs filters, encodings, and log-heavy transactions
- Exploit idea: use valid subscription filters as the amplifier
- Invariant to test: notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: compare pre-filter candidate counts to delivered-notification counts
