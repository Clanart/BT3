# Q3180: filter_program_results many-pubkey memory balloon

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_program_results` by use in-scope program subscriptions with legal filters with program subscription filters, encodings, and hot account streams so that one user can create enough cache/index state through attacker-owned accounts to exhaust memory faster than cleanup responds, breaking the invariant that attacker-owned account fanout must not create unbounded cache or index growth and leading to `DoS Attacks`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_program_results
- Entrypoint: use in-scope program subscriptions with legal filters
- Attacker controls: program subscription filters, encodings, and hot account streams
- Exploit idea: use many small valid accounts as the amplifier
- Invariant to test: attacker-owned account fanout must not create unbounded cache or index growth
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS Attacks
- Fast validation: create many valid attacker-controlled accounts and track cache/index growth
