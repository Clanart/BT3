# Q5110: receive-underlying via transfer: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, can an unprivileged attacker make `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `transfer` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `transfer` with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
