# Q0976: calc-liq-debt-repay via liquidate-redeem: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `calc-liq-debt-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723) in a state where it normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? Given that it takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay` takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
