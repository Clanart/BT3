# Q0541: check_shop_domain: A `shop` that sanitizes to another merchant's domain so `instal...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `shop` param and `host`/`embedded` params) reach `check_shop_domain / current_shopify_domain / installed_shop_session` in app/controllers/concerns/shopify_app/ensure_installed.rb via GET any EnsureInstalled controller action, supplying a `shop` that sanitizes to another merchant's domain so `installed_shop_session` loads that store's offline session, so that the loaded installed shop session must correspond to the merchant proven to control the shop, not a raw param is violated, leading to cross-shop access: loading/acting with another store's offline session? Specifically confirm that the full public-route flow yields only a rejection or attacker-own-scope result.

## Target
- File/function: app/controllers/concerns/shopify_app/ensure_installed.rb — `check_shop_domain / current_shopify_domain / installed_shop_session`
- Entrypoint: GET any EnsureInstalled controller action
- Attacker controls: the `shop` param and `host`/`embedded` params — specifically a `shop` that sanitizes to another merchant's domain so `installed_shop_session` loads that store's offline session.
- Exploit idea: Run the full public route end-to-end with the crafted input and confirm the real-world outcome is safe.
- Invariant to test: the loaded installed shop session must correspond to the merchant proven to control the shop, not a raw param
- Expected Immunefi impact: cross-shop access: loading/acting with another store's offline session (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: end-to-end integration test through the real route asserting the attacker outcome is a reject/own-scope only.
