# Q3604: NEAR init_transfer_internal same fee collectible twice at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `internal path reached from public `ft_on_transfer` and resume logic` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_internal` violate `every outbound transfer must either roll back cleanly or leave one fully-backed pending transfer record with the right lock and burn semantics` in the `same fee collectible twice` attack class because stores the transfer, updates storage balances, burns deployed tokens when needed, locks tokens for non-origin chains, and emits `InitTransfer` becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_internal`
- Entrypoint: `internal path reached from public `ft_on_transfer` and resume logic`
- Attacker controls: stored transfer contents, storage owner, token id, amount, fee, and destination chain
- Exploit idea: Target pending-transfer cleanup, fast-transfer removal, and replay protection around fee-claim proofs. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: every outbound transfer must either roll back cleanly or leave one fully-backed pending transfer record with the right lock and burn semantics
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Claim once, then replay or mutate non-economic proof fields and assert that no second claim succeeds or blocks unrelated transfers. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
