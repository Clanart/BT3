# Q4915: WombatPoolHelper.depositNative - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Under an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, is there an unprivileged sequence of `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` that leaves `this.balance(msg.sender)` unreconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`, violates the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard, and delivers Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `this.balance(msg.sender)` must stay reconciled with `lockedAmount[msg.sender]`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence atomically under an active mWOM-flagged fee entry routes the harvest through SmartWomConvert, asserting at the end that `this.balance(msg.sender)` still equals `lockedAmount[msg.sender]` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
