# Q3595: WombatPoolHelper.depositNative - V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. With msg.value and _minimumLiquidity under attacker control and a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, can an unprivileged caller sequence `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` so that `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` and `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal and realising Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Precondition: a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper.
- Invariant to test: the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal; concretely, `_liquidity burned via burnReceiptToken` must stay reconciled with `the deposit-token balance delta paid out by WombatStaking.withdraw`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (msg.value and _minimumLiquidity) under a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, asserting on every row that the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal.
