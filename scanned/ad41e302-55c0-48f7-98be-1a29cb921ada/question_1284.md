# Q1284: get-cached-indexes via accrue: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block reach `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) in a state where it judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set? Given that it reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `accrue` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `get-cached-indexes` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
