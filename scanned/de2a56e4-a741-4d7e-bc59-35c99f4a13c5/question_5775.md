# Q5775: WombatBribeManager.castVotesAndClaimBribes - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `castVotesAndClaimBribes(address[] lps, bool swapForBnb)` under the bribe contract for the pool registers more than one reward token and force `delegatedPool votes` apart from `totalVlMgpInVote`, breaking the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates for Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `castVotesAndClaimBribes(address[] lps, bool swapForBnb)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `castVotesAndClaimBribes(address[] lps, bool swapForBnb)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the cast and the immediately following claim inside one transaction
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the bribe contract for the pool registers more than one reward token.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `delegatedPool votes` must stay reconciled with `totalVlMgpInVote`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Invariant/fuzz run over `castVotesAndClaimBribes(address[] lps, bool swapForBnb)`: constrain the setup so that the bribe contract for the pool registers more than one reward token, fuzz the attacker inputs (the cast and the immediately following claim inside one transaction), and assert after every call that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates.
