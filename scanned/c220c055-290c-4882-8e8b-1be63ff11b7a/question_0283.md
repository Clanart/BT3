# Q283: hash collapse distinct inputs into one accepted state via public key and signature byte encodings

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker verify signatures through consensus or binding APIs targeting `hash` in `crates/chia-bls/src/secret_key.rs` with public key and signature byte encodings when the attacker can choose ordering inside a batch make chia_rs collapse distinct inputs into one accepted state, violating the invariant that domain-separated signed messages cannot be replayed, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Consensus-valid spend, block generator, proof, or block record path can mint, burn, steal, double-spend, or mis-account Chia coins/rewards/fees?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-bls/src/secret_key.rs:184` / `hash`
- Entrypoint: verify signatures through consensus or binding APIs
- Attacker controls: public key and signature byte encodings
- Exploit idea: Drive `hash` through its public caller path using public key and signature byte encodings; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: domain-separated signed messages cannot be replayed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Consensus-valid spend, block generator, proof, or block record path can mint, burn, steal, double-spend, or mis-account Chia coins/rewards/fees
- Fast validation: construct aggregate signature vectors with duplicates, infinity, and swapped messages.
