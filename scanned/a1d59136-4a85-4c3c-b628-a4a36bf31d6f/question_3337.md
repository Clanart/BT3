# Q3337: NEAR send_tokens helper asset-branch confusion on finalization via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `internal helper reached from public finalize and fast paths` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `asset-branch confusion on finalization` under chooses between wNEAR unwrap, bridge-token mint, `ft_transfer`, and `ft_transfer_call` depending on token type and message presence, violating `asset-delivery helper logic must not let attacker-controlled message shape or gas availability change the economic branch in a way that unbacks or strands funds`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens`
- Entrypoint: `internal helper reached from public finalize and fast paths`
- Attacker controls: token id, recipient account, amount, optional message, current gas budget, and whether the token is wNEAR, deployed, or external
- Exploit idea: Target native-versus-wrapped, vault-versus-mint, ERC-20-versus-ERC-1155, or custom-minter-versus-custody branches. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: asset-delivery helper logic must not let attacker-controlled message shape or gas availability change the economic branch in a way that unbacks or strands funds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Assert that every accepted settlement lands on exactly the branch implied by the validated source asset type and mapping state. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
