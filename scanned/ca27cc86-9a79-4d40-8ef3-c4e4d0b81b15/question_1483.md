# Q1483: process_and_record_aged_transactions artifact memory blowup

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_and_record_aged_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with aged blockhashes, durable nonces, conflicting write sets, and batch scheduling order such that logs, return data, inner instructions, or side-channel artifacts created downstream scale much faster than request size, breaking the invariant that execution artifact growth must stay bounded per transaction and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/banking_stage/consumer.rs::process_and_record_aged_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: aged blockhashes, durable nonces, conflicting write sets, and batch scheduling order
- Exploit idea: use legal execution artifacts as the amplifier instead of raw packet size
- Invariant to test: execution artifact growth must stay bounded per transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: run the same heavy transaction repeatedly and correlate artifact size with resident memory
