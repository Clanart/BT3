# Q1530: check_fee_payer_unlocked fee-payer unlock split

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `check_fee_payer_unlocked` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with fee-payer aliases, duplicate accounts, rent edge cases, and batch ordering such that fee-payer lock or unlock handling may diverge from the accounts actually charged later, breaking the invariant that fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/banking_stage/consumer.rs::check_fee_payer_unlocked
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: fee-payer aliases, duplicate accounts, rent edge cases, and batch ordering
- Exploit idea: try to free or relock the fee payer at the wrong moment
- Invariant to test: fee-payer lock lifetime must cover exactly the charged execution lifecycle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace fee-payer lock state across retries, conflicts, and partial failures
