# Q4331: get-asset-value via liquidate-multi: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
`get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, use that to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-multi` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
