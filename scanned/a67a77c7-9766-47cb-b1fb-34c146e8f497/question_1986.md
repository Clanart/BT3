# Q1986: call-liquidate via liquidate: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `debt-amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `call-liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `call-liquidate` invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907` -> `call-liquidate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `call-liquidate` invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot. Reach it through `liquidate` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `debt-amount` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `call-liquidate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
