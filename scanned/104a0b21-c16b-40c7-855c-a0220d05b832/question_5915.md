# Q5915: WombatBribeManager.harvestSinglePool - offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged

## Question
Note that in wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)` under the attacker has just cancelled a cooldown so getUserVotable jumped upward and force `getVoteForLp(lp) from the Wombat voter` apart from `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp`, breaking the invariant that a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates for Critical - Governance voting result manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)` (mechanism: offsetting deltas keep the net total unchanged)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the lp array, forwarded straight into WombatStaking.vote with zero deltas and caller set to address(0)
- Exploit idea: because the ceiling test uses only the accumulated net totalUserVote, an array that adds to one pool and removes from another leaves userTotalVotedInVlmgp untouched while both per-pool totals and both rewarder balances move. Precondition: the attacker has just cancelled a cooldown so getUserVotable jumped upward.
- Invariant to test: a rebalancing vote must be validated against the real per-pool positions it creates; concretely, `getVoteForLp(lp) from the Wombat voter` must stay reconciled with `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Governance voting result manipulation
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `harvestSinglePool(address[] _lps)` sequence atomically under the attacker has just cancelled a cooldown so getUserVotable jumped upward, asserting at the end that `getVoteForLp(lp) from the Wombat voter` still equals `poolInfos[lp].totalVoteInVlmgp` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
