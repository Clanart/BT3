# Q1428: deposit rent floor drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `deposit` by submit transactions invoking writable-account instructions with lamport amounts, account ownership transitions, cpi ordering, and close/reopen patterns such that account resize, close, or reopen patterns can use a stale rent-exemption view, breaking the invariant that rent-exemption checks must use the final committed account layout and balance and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::deposit
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking writable-account instructions
- Attacker controls: lamport amounts, account ownership transitions, CPI ordering, and close/reopen patterns
- Exploit idea: search for pre-resize or pre-close rent assumptions that survive too long
- Invariant to test: rent-exemption checks must use the final committed account layout and balance
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: use realloc/close/open patterns and diff rent floor checks against final account sizes
