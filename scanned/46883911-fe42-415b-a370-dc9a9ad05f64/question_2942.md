# Q2942: notify_slot queue-drain mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_slot` by trigger slot-related subscriptions and then drive hot transaction flow with slow consumer behavior and high-frequency slot events so that the queue behind this function drains more slowly than one valid subscription shape can fill it even at realistic rates, breaking the invariant that one valid subscription must not create a persistently negative drain ratio and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_slot
- Entrypoint: trigger slot-related subscriptions and then drive hot transaction flow
- Attacker controls: slow consumer behavior and high-frequency slot events
- Exploit idea: treat steady-state drain ratio as the invariant
- Invariant to test: one valid subscription must not create a persistently negative drain ratio
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: measure fill/drain ratio for the hottest legal notification source
