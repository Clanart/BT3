# Q2118: spawn_stake_weighted_qos_server rent floor drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `spawn_stake_weighted_qos_server` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one client with connection counts, packet pacing, payload sizes, and unstaked-versus-staked looking client identities such that account resize, close, or reopen patterns can use a stale rent-exemption view, breaking the invariant that rent-exemption checks must use the final committed account layout and balance and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/quic.rs::spawn_stake_weighted_qos_server
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one client
- Attacker controls: connection counts, packet pacing, payload sizes, and unstaked-versus-staked looking client identities
- Exploit idea: search for pre-resize or pre-close rent assumptions that survive too long
- Invariant to test: rent-exemption checks must use the final committed account layout and balance
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: use realloc/close/open patterns and diff rent floor checks against final account sizes
