# Q0936: increment via supply-collateral-add: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) in a state where it satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept? Given that it advances the user-id nonce, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `increment` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
