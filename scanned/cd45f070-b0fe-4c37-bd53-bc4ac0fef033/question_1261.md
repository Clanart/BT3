# Q1261: Starknet init_transfer burn or lock before irreversible state at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public Starknet outbound transfer entrypoint` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::init_transfer` violate `one outbound Starknet transfer must consume the exact caller-held asset that the event later authorizes on destination chains` in the `burn or lock before irreversible state` attack class because checks pause flags, increments the origin nonce, burns bridge tokens when required, and emits an `InitTransfer` event using a normalized token address becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `starknet/src/omni_bridge.cairo::init_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `public Starknet outbound transfer entrypoint`
- Attacker controls: token address, amount, fee, native fee, recipient `ByteArray`, message `ByteArray`, and caller
- Exploit idea: Look for branches where custody changes happen before the final pending-state, mapping, or callback outcome is fixed. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: one outbound Starknet transfer must consume the exact caller-held asset that the event later authorizes on destination chains
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Model failures between custody changes and state writes, then assert that no branch both consumes user value and allows the transfer to be replayed or dropped. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
