# Q839: NEAR ft_on_transfer dispatcher recipient or message ambiguity via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `NEAR NEP-141 `ft_on_transfer` callback into bridge dispatch` and then replay or reorder matching fast-transfer completion or fee-claim leg so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::ft_on_transfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `recipient or message ambiguity` under dispatches untrusted `BridgeOnTransferMsg` into `init_transfer`, `fast_fin_transfer`, `utxo_fin_transfer`, or `swap_migrated_token` and explicitly trusts `env::signer_account_id()` instead of `sender_id` for storage payment decisions, violating `the chosen branch, payer identity, amount, and downstream transfer type must stay aligned so one callback cannot burn, lock, or settle value on the wrong path`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::ft_on_transfer`
- Entrypoint: `NEAR NEP-141 `ft_on_transfer` callback into bridge dispatch`
- Attacker controls: token contract choice, `sender_id`, `signer_id`, amount, JSON `msg` variant, recipient, fee, native fee, `external_id`, fast-transfer payloads, and UTXO payloads
- Exploit idea: Exploit non-canonical string, ByteArray, hex, or account-id forms to make one source-side intent resolve to a different destination-side recipient or message. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: the chosen branch, payer identity, amount, and downstream transfer type must stay aligned so one callback cannot burn, lock, or settle value on the wrong path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Cross-check source-side serialization against every downstream parser and assert that equivalent-looking inputs cannot resolve to distinct destination accounts or app messages. Then replay or reorder matching fast-transfer completion or fee-claim leg and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
