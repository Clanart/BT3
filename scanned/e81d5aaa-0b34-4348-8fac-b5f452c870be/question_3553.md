# Q3553: EVM custom-minter bridge path delivery callback leaves inconsistent state through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public `initTransfer` and `finTransfer` when `customMinters[token] != 0`` with control over token address, custom-minter registration state, amount, and recipient and desynchronize `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol customMinters branches` from the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `delivery callback leaves inconsistent state` attack class because delegates burn and mint semantics to an external custom minter instead of standard bridge-token logic, violating `custom-minter branches must not let a token escape custody or mint semantics that the bridge assumes for replay protection and accounting`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol customMinters branches`
- Entrypoint: `public `initTransfer` and `finTransfer` when `customMinters[token] != 0``
- Attacker controls: token address, custom-minter registration state, amount, and recipient
- Exploit idea: Focus on `ft_transfer_call`, unwrap callbacks, and post-delivery resolution that decide whether to burn, refund, or remove records. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting.
- Invariant to test: custom-minter branches must not let a token escape custody or mint semantics that the bridge assumes for replay protection and accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Enumerate callback results and assert that each result maps to exactly one consistent combination of delivered value, replay state, and storage refund. Also assert cross-module consistency between `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol customMinters branches` and the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting after every branch.
