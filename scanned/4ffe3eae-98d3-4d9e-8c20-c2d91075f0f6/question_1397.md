# Q1397: to json dict produce a Rust/Python disagreement via JSON dictionary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker deserialize JSON dictionaries targeting `to_json_dict` in `crates/chia-traits/src/to_json_dict.rs` with JSON dictionary values when values sit exactly at max/min integer boundaries make chia_rs produce a Rust/Python disagreement, violating the invariant that trusted parse mode is not exposed to attacker-controlled non-canonical bytes, and realistically causing the in-scope impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption?

## Target
- File/function: `crates/chia-traits/src/to_json_dict.rs:53` / `to_json_dict`
- Entrypoint: deserialize JSON dictionaries
- Attacker controls: JSON dictionary values
- Exploit idea: Drive `to_json_dict` through its public caller path using JSON dictionary values; combine ordering, boundary, or alternate encoding cases until the checked state differs from the consensus/model expectation.
- Invariant to test: trusted parse mode is not exposed to attacker-controlled non-canonical bytes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Valid unprivileged CLVM program, spend bundle, block, proof, or serialized network object can trigger deterministic consensus divergence, chain halt, or committed state corruption
- Fast validation: assert trusted parse is only used after a canonical parse boundary.
