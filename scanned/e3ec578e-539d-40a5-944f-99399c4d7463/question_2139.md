# Q2139: spawn_simple_qos_server loaded-data undercount

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `spawn_simple_qos_server` by submit transactions directly over tpu quic from one client with connection counts, packet pacing, payload sizes, and source-ip churn timing such that loaded-accounts-data accounting can be made smaller than the real memory footprint or persisted delta, breaking the invariant that loaded account data size must track real loaded and committed state accurately and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: streamer/src/quic.rs::spawn_simple_qos_server
- Entrypoint: submit transactions directly over TPU QUIC from one client
- Attacker controls: connection counts, packet pacing, payload sizes, and source-IP churn timing
- Exploit idea: aim for account-resize and ALT-heavy transactions that undercount loaded state
- Invariant to test: loaded account data size must track real loaded and committed state accurately
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: compare loaded-accounts-data counters to actual touched and resized account bytes
