# Q2089: WombatPoolHelper.depositLP - stray receipt tokens on the helper are swept into the next deposit

## Question
Consider wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, where the balance-delta measurement in _deposit() and depositLP() assumes the helper holds no unattributed stakingToken, so any receipt token left there by a partial mint, a rounding residue or a direct transfer is credited to the next depositor. Assuming the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, can an unprivileged attacker turn this into a divergence between `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` and `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` via `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`, breaking the invariant that a helper must never credit a depositor with receipt tokens it did not mint for that deposit and producing Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: stray receipt tokens on the helper are swept into the next deposit)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller
- Exploit idea: the balance-delta measurement in _deposit() and depositLP() assumes the helper holds no unattributed stakingToken, so any receipt token left there by a partial mint, a rounding residue or a direct transfer is credited to the next depositor. Precondition: the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction.
- Invariant to test: a helper must never credit a depositor with receipt tokens it did not mint for that deposit; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, have the attacker run `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` versus `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
