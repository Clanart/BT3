# Q3566: Duplicate Commitment Padding By Reusing Data Cross Module

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `pallet_ismp_relayer::accumulate_fees(origin=None, withdrawal_proof)` with attacker-controlled withdrawal proofs, destination proofs, payee bytes, signatures, claim destinations, and replay ordering and reusing data that should belong to one chain, module, order, state machine, or payee in another publicly reachable path, and make `accumulate` inflate a fee-accumulation or withdrawal batch by repeating one request commitment more than once so `the accumulated fee total` becomes inconsistent with `the sum of unique eligible commitments only`, breaking the invariant that a relayer fee batch must pay only once per unique delivered commitment and leading to Critical: wrongful mint, unlock, withdrawal, refund, or redirect of protocol-controlled or user escrowed assets?

## Target
- File/function: modules/pallets/relayer/src/accumulate.rs::accumulate
- Entrypoint: pallet_ismp_relayer::accumulate_fees(origin=None, withdrawal_proof)
- Attacker controls: withdrawal proofs, destination proofs, payee bytes, signatures, claim destinations, and replay ordering
- Exploit idea: Inflate a fee-accumulation or withdrawal batch by repeating one request commitment more than once. Craft two public flows that share one byte string or hash and check whether module, chain, or payee binding is enforced everywhere.
- Invariant to test: a relayer fee batch must pay only once per unique delivered commitment
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: wrongful mint, unlock, withdrawal, refund, or redirect of protocol-controlled or user escrowed assets.
- Fast validation: Construct a batch with repeated commitments and assert accumulation, claimed flags, and withdrawal balances count each eligible commitment once. Feed the same bytes through two reachable entrypoints and assert the second path rejects instead of inheriting the first path's authorization.
