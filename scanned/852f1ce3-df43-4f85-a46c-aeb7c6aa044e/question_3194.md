# Q3194: filter_logs_results stale cache replay

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_logs_results` by use in-scope logs subscriptions with legal filters with logs filters, encodings, and log-heavy transactions so that stale cached account content can outlive the storage or bank state that later logic expects, breaking the invariant that caches must not serve account data from an impossible slot/state combination and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_logs_results
- Entrypoint: use in-scope logs subscriptions with legal filters
- Attacker controls: logs filters, encodings, and log-heavy transactions
- Exploit idea: read an impossible old value after the canonical state has changed
- Invariant to test: caches must not serve account data from an impossible slot/state combination
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: race rewrites and immediate reads, then diff cache-derived results against storage and bank views
