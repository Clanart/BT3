# Q3027: enqueue_notification slot-cache latest drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `enqueue_notification` by trigger many hot notifications from one subscription shape with subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams so that latest-account selection can choose the wrong slot under same-pubkey churn, breaking the invariant that latest-account resolution must pick the true latest visible slot and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::enqueue_notification
- Entrypoint: trigger many hot notifications from one subscription shape
- Attacker controls: subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams
- Exploit idea: target multiple nearby slot writes to one pubkey
- Invariant to test: latest-account resolution must pick the true latest visible slot
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: rewrite one account across nearby slots and verify which version low-rate reads observe
