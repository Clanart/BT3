# Q3850: NEAR fast_fin_transfer dispatcher replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through ``ft_on_transfer` branch for fast finalization` and then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fast_fin_transfer` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `replay guard can be bypassed or consumed incorrectly` under requires a trusted relayer, denormalizes amount and fee for the origin token, checks whether the referenced transfer is already finalised, and either pays a Near recipient immediately or emits a new transfer to another chain, violating `a fast path must never let relayers front-load value for an event that can later settle differently, twice, or with a different fee/recipient binding`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::fast_fin_transfer`
- Entrypoint: ``ft_on_transfer` branch for fast finalization`
- Attacker controls: token id, amount, signer identity as relayer, transfer id, recipient, fee, message, and optional storage deposit amount
- Exploit idea: Stress replay-protection state keyed only by nonce, transfer id, or bitmap position across branches and chains. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: a fast path must never let relayers front-load value for an event that can later settle differently, twice, or with a different fee/recipient binding
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Replay valid proofs/signatures with altered non-economic fields and assert that only the exact originally-settled event is rejected as already used. Then replay or reorder later fee-claim proof submission and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
