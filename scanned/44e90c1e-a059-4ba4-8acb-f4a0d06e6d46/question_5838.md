# Q5838: MasterMagpie.deposit - lpSupply inflation by direct token donation

## Question
In rewards/MasterMagpie.sol, _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Does `deposit(address _stakingToken, uint256 _amount)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the victim is mid-cooldown in VLMGP so getRewardablePercentWAD is still 1e18, so that `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].available` diverges from `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].amount`, the invariant that MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply is broken, and the result is High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/MasterMagpie.sol -> `deposit(address _stakingToken, uint256 _amount)` (mechanism: lpSupply inflation by direct token donation)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(address _stakingToken, uint256 _amount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _stakingToken, _amount, and the ERC20 the pool was registered with
- Exploit idea: _calLpSupply() returns IERC20(_stakingToken).balanceOf(address(this)) for every non-vlMGP/non-mWomSV pool, so a raw ERC20 transfer of the receipt token straight to MasterMagpie inflates the accMGPPerShare denominator without crediting any UserInfo.amount. Precondition: the victim is mid-cooldown in VLMGP so getRewardablePercentWAD is still 1e18.
- Invariant to test: MGP emitted over an interval must be fully distributable to the sum of UserInfo.amount, and accMGPPerShare must only ever be divided by staked-and-credited supply; concretely, `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].available` must stay reconciled with `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].amount`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the victim is mid-cooldown in VLMGP so getRewardablePercentWAD is still 1e18, then assert `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].available` and `userInfo[_stakingToken][user].amount` end identical in both runs.
