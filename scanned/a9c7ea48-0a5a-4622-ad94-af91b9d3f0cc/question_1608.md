# Q1608: current_shopify_session_id: A blank `requested_shopify_domain` so the mismatch guard return...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params) reach `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb via GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy, supplying a blank `requested_shopify_domain` so the mismatch guard returns false and skips shop validation, so that session id must come from a fully verified id_token (sig, aud, dest, exp) before any load or exchange is violated, leading to authentication bypass / minting an access token for a shop the attacker does not own? Specifically confirm that a wrong-secret or tampered artifact is always rejected before any side effect.

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/token_exchange.rb — `current_shopify_session_id / retrieve_session_from_token_exchange`
- Entrypoint: GET/POST any EnsureHasSession or EnsureInstalled action under the new embedded auth strategy
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` (Authorization header or URL param) and the `shop`/`host` query params — specifically a blank `requested_shopify_domain` so the mismatch guard returns false and skips shop validation.
- Exploit idea: Run the exact flow with a deliberately-wrong secret/signature/token to prove verification actually rejects it.
- Invariant to test: session id must come from a fully verified id_token (sig, aud, dest, exp) before any load or exchange
- Expected Immunefi impact: authentication bypass / minting an access token for a shop the attacker does not own (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: negative-control test asserting a wrong-secret/wrong-signature/tampered-token request is rejected with no side effect.
