# Q1220: check_reserved_keys reserved-key bypass

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `check_reserved_keys` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with reserved-looking pubkeys, duplicated account metas, and versioned message layouts such that duplicated accounts or versioned message features let attacker-controlled keys slip past reserved-key assumptions, breaking the invariant that reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::check_reserved_keys
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: reserved-looking pubkeys, duplicated account metas, and versioned message layouts
- Exploit idea: search for paths where reserved-key checks see a different key set than execution
- Invariant to test: reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: construct versioned transactions whose ALT-expanded account set changes the effective key view
