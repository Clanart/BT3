# Q2458: get_pubkey_account_for_slot read-only cache incoherence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `get_pubkey_account_for_slot` by make low-rate in-scope rpc reads while transactions keep rewriting one pubkey with same-pubkey rewrites across slots, immediate reads, and cached-versus-storage lookups so that read-only caching can return a version that writable/runtime paths would reject as stale, breaking the invariant that read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::get_pubkey_account_for_slot
- Entrypoint: make low-rate in-scope RPC reads while transactions keep rewriting one pubkey
- Attacker controls: same-pubkey rewrites across slots, immediate reads, and cached-versus-storage lookups
- Exploit idea: diff read-only and runtime-visible answers for the same account
- Invariant to test: read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare read-only cache results to direct runtime/bank reads after writes
