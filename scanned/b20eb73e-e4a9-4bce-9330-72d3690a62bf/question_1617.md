# Q1617: process_message queue fairness break

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_message` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with versioned messages, duplicate accounts, alt expansion, and cpi-heavy instruction graphs such that attacker-chosen transactions make this function occupy shared scheduling resources long enough to starve cheaper work, breaking the invariant that one heavy transaction shape must not monopolize shared scheduling resources and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs::process_message
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, duplicate accounts, ALT expansion, and CPI-heavy instruction graphs
- Exploit idea: measure unfair occupancy rather than raw throughput
- Invariant to test: one heavy transaction shape must not monopolize shared scheduling resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: replay one heavy shape alongside cheap transfers and compare scheduling latency
