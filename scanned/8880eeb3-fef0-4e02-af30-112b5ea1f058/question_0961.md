# Q961: load_and_execute_transactions account-size meter wrap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_and_execute_transactions` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with versioned messages, alt-heavy account sets, cpi depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets such that account-size or memory-region arithmetic may wrap, saturate, or truncate on attacker-chosen boundaries, breaking the invariant that size meters and offsets must match true account memory bounds and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::load_and_execute_transactions
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: versioned messages, ALT-heavy account sets, CPI depth, compute budgets, and conflicting write sets
- Exploit idea: search for silent integer boundary behavior in size/accounting code
- Invariant to test: size meters and offsets must match true account memory bounds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: hit the largest legal account sizes and offset combinations
