# Q1988: MsgEthereumTx.VerifySender - Empty From Falls Back Inconsistently Between Rpc And Ante

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit a Cosmos-wrapped Ethereum transaction through `ante verification of signed Ethereum message sender` while controlling `extension options` and `From bytes`, under the precondition that the same tx is seen in CheckTx and ReCheckTx, drive `NewAnteHandler route selection -> Ethereum ante decorators -> MsgEthereumTx execution` in `x/evm/types/msg.go::MsgEthereumTx.VerifySender` so that empty From falls back inconsistently between RPC and ante, violating the invariant that extension options must route every message through the intended ante chain, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/types/msg.go::MsgEthereumTx.VerifySender`
- Entrypoint: `ante verification of signed Ethereum message sender`
- Attacker controls: `extension options`, `From bytes`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: empty From falls back inconsistently between RPC and ante through `NewAnteHandler route selection -> Ethereum ante decorators -> MsgEthereumTx execution`.
- Invariant to test: extension options must route every message through the intended ante chain.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: add a fuzz case varying the attacker-controlled fields and differential-check against go-ethereum for tx validity, gas, nonce, and code/storage effects.
