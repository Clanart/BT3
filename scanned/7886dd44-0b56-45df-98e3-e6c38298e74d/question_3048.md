# Q3048: NEAR bind_token entry fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public `bind_token` proof-submission flow` with boundary-controlled inputs covering minimal deposits, maximal storage payloads, and withdrawal edges and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token` violate `binding an existing Near token to a foreign asset must remain one-to-one and fully collateral-accounted across proof replay, partial failure, and refund paths` in the `fake bridge-controlled token accepted as canonical` attack class because verifies a deploy-token proof, writes token mappings in `bind_token_callback`, then refunds leftover deposit in a second callback becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::bind_token`
- Entrypoint: `public `bind_token` proof-submission flow`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, source chain selection, attached deposit, and timing versus token deployment
- Exploit idea: Target checks that only inspect mint authority, owner, or one mapping row without proving the full asset identity. Concentrate on minimal deposits, maximal storage payloads, and withdrawal edges.
- Invariant to test: binding an existing Near token to a foreign asset must remain one-to-one and fully collateral-accounted across proof replay, partial failure, and refund paths
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Construct plausible fake bridge-controlled assets and assert that deployment, settlement, and forwarding reject them unless they are the canonical mapping for that remote asset. Sweep boundary values for minimal deposits, maximal storage payloads, and withdrawal edges and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
