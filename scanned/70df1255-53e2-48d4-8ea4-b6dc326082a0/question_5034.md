# Q5034: mWOM.deposit - rewardRatio is explicitly allowed to exceed one hundred percent

## Question
In wombat/mWOM.sol, the contract comment states the ratio can be more than 100%, and setRewardRatio applies no DENOMINATOR ceiling, so the vlMGP paid can exceed the value of the WOM deposited and the incentive pot drains faster than it is funded. Does `deposit(uint256 _amount)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under the attacker repeats the call across several addresses in the same block, so that `_amount minted as mWOM` diverges from `mintedVeWomAmount returned by IWombatStaking.convertWOM`, the invariant that the value paid out per unit deposited must be bounded so the incentive cannot exceed its funding is broken, and the result is Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/mWOM.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount)` (mechanism: rewardRatio is explicitly allowed to exceed one hundred percent)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, which mints mWOM 1:1 while leaving the WOM sitting in this contract unlocked
- Exploit idea: the contract comment states the ratio can be more than 100%, and setRewardRatio applies no DENOMINATOR ceiling, so the vlMGP paid can exceed the value of the WOM deposited and the incentive pot drains faster than it is funded. Precondition: the attacker repeats the call across several addresses in the same block.
- Invariant to test: the value paid out per unit deposited must be bounded so the incentive cannot exceed its funding; concretely, `_amount minted as mWOM` must stay reconciled with `mintedVeWomAmount returned by IWombatStaking.convertWOM`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the attacker repeats the call across several addresses in the same block, have the attacker run `deposit(uint256 _amount)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_amount minted as mWOM` versus `mintedVeWomAmount returned by IWombatStaking.convertWOM` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
