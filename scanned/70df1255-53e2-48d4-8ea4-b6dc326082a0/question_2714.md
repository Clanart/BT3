# Q2714: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Under the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, is there an unprivileged sequence of `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` that leaves `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` unreconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`, violates the invariant that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent, and delivers High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: safeApprove without reset before depositFor into MasterMagpie)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: _stake() calls IERC20(stakingToken).safeApprove(masterMagpie, _amount) with no prior zeroing, so any allowance residue left by a depositFor that under-consumes permanently disables deposits through this helper. Precondition: the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg.
- Invariant to test: an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool) under the caller sets _minAmount to zero on the withdrawal leg, asserting on every row that an approval on the deposit hot path must be idempotent.
