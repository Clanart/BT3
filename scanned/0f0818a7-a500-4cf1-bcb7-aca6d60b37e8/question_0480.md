# Q0480: resolve-interpolation-points via supply-collateral-add: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position state the final collateral-add is validated against across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `resolve-interpolation-points` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
