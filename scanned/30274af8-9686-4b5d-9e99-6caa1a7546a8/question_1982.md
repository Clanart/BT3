# Q1982: get-position via collateral-add: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output? `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap, so the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-add` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the position's existing collateral and debt composition varied, and assert that the value `get-position` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
