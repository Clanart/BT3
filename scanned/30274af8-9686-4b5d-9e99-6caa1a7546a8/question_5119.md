# Q5119: get-position via collateral-remove-redeem: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), then read `get-position` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
