# Q5536: WombatPoolHelper.deposit - _minimumLiquidity is caller-supplied on the deposit leg

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol - deposit() and depositNative() forward the caller's _minimumLiquidity into the Wombat deposit, so a caller can accept a deposit that mints far less LP than fair while the receipt mint is taken from the resulting delta. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool, under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, exploit this through `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` to break the reconciliation between `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` and `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid` and the invariant that a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded, yielding Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: _minimumLiquidity is caller-supplied on the deposit leg)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `deposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool
- Exploit idea: deposit() and depositNative() forward the caller's _minimumLiquidity into the Wombat deposit, so a caller can accept a deposit that mints far less LP than fair while the receipt mint is taken from the resulting delta. Precondition: the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address.
- Invariant to test: a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded; concretely, `IERC20(stakingToken).totalSupply()` must stay reconciled with `the MasterWombat staked balance for pid`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Table test over the boundary values of the attacker inputs (_amount and _minimumLiquidity, forwarded verbatim into the Wombat pool) under the receipt token is minted to the helper while the credit is directed at a different address, asserting on every row that a deposit must not be able to credit receipt tokens against an execution the caller deliberately degraded.
