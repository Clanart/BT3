# Q555: StateDB.SubBalance - Selfdestruct Burn Debits After Recipient Receives Value

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker execute a contract that moves EVM-denom value through nested calls through `EVM balance debit for CALL value, gas buy, or selfdestruct burn` while controlling `storage dirty keys` and `bank balance`, under the precondition that a contract performs nested value transfers and SELFDESTRUCT, drive `EVM CALL/SELFDESTRUCT -> StateDB native cache -> RevertToSnapshot -> Commit` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.SubBalance` so that selfdestruct burn debits after recipient receives value, violating the invariant that bank balances and EVM StateDB balances must remain one-to-one for the EVM denom, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.SubBalance`
- Entrypoint: `EVM balance debit for CALL value, gas buy, or selfdestruct burn`
- Attacker controls: `storage dirty keys`, `bank balance`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: selfdestruct burn debits after recipient receives value through `EVM CALL/SELFDESTRUCT -> StateDB native cache -> RevertToSnapshot -> Commit`.
- Invariant to test: bank balances and EVM StateDB balances must remain one-to-one for the EVM denom.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: write a focused Go unit test around the target function and assert bank supply, sender balance, nonce, code hash, logs, and receipt status before and after.
