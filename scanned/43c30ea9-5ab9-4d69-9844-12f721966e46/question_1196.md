# Q1196: Exploit ordering assumptions in new_with_wt_tx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use attacker-controlled Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents so `new_with_wt_tx` validates the right inputs in the wrong order, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and breaking the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/structs.rs::new_with_wt_tx
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Exploit idea: validate the right pieces in the wrong order using Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Reorg-handling bug (Bitcoin-side or Citrea-side) that causes prolonged halt, inconsistent views, or unsafe rollback behavior
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
