# Q1207: Exploit ordering assumptions in deserialize_txout

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use attacker-controlled Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents so `deserialize_txout` validates the right inputs in the wrong order, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/structs.rs::deserialize_txout
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Exploit idea: validate the right pieces in the wrong order using Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
