# Q1297: insert via collateral-remove: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, drive `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) — which rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id — to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, then read `insert` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
