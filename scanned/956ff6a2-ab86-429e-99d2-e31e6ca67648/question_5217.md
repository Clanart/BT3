# Q5217: WombatPoolHelper.depositNative - V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol: WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Under the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, is there an unprivileged sequence of `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` that leaves `pid cached at construction` unreconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, violates the invariant that the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal, and delivers Critical - Protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: V1 exposes no depositFor so every credit is msg.sender)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: WombatPoolHelper.sol has no depositFor, so _deposit is always called with _for equal to msg.sender, which makes the receipt-mint-to-helper and credit-to-caller mismatch the only attribution gap on this contract. Precondition: the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling.
- Invariant to test: the single attribution path must still guarantee that minted receipts and credited stake are equal; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Unit test with mocked Wombat and router legs: arrange the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, call `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`, and assert `pid cached at construction` equals `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` and that no account can withdraw more than it put in.
