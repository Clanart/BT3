# Q3622: Replay context into citrea_large_body_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync with attacker-controlled Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering so `citrea_large_body_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the L1/L2 height pair treated as finalized and safe to bridge against to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/tests.rs::citrea_large_body_tx_flow_commits_and_mines_with_min_feerate
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed Citrea withdrawal/deposit logs and their ordering in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
