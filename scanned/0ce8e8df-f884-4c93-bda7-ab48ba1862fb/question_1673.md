# Q1673: Exploit witness/annex edge cases in total_work_and_watchtower_flags

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit witness, annex, or script-path edge cases in the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values so `total_work_and_watchtower_flags` verifies a different Bitcoin statement than later settlement relies on, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and violating the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds?

## Target
- File/function: circuits-lib/src/bridge_circuit/mod.rs::total_work_and_watchtower_flags
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Exploit idea: make verification hash a different Bitcoin statement than settlement later uses via the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Permanent freezing of bridged funds
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
