# Q3168: filter_signature_result valid-input crash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_signature_result` by use in-scope signature subscriptions and many status changes with signature subscription parameters and hot status churn so that validly encoded account/notification state or subscription flow can still reach a panic or abort, breaking the invariant that valid inputs and valid subscription flows must not crash this path and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_signature_result
- Entrypoint: use in-scope signature subscriptions and many status changes
- Attacker controls: signature subscription parameters and hot status churn
- Exploit idea: treat state-filtering and watcher code as crash surfaces
- Invariant to test: valid inputs and valid subscription flows must not crash this path
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: fuzz only valid subscription parameters and event payload shapes while monitoring for crashes
