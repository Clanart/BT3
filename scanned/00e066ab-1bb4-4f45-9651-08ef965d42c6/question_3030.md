# Q3030: StateDB.AddBalance - Credit To Selfdestructed Account Is Not Burned On Commit

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker execute a contract that moves EVM-denom value through nested calls through `EVM balance credit from CALL, SELFDESTRUCT, reward, or refund` while controlling `native action writes` and `account deletion timing`, under the precondition that the sender has just enough EVM-denom balance for the transaction, drive `StateDB.Commit -> conflict check -> native cache flush -> account deletion/balance burn` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.AddBalance` so that credit to selfdestructed account is not burned on commit, violating the invariant that journaled reverts must roll back native bank writes and EVM dirty state together, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.AddBalance`
- Entrypoint: `EVM balance credit from CALL, SELFDESTRUCT, reward, or refund`
- Attacker controls: `native action writes`, `account deletion timing`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: credit to selfdestructed account is not burned on commit through `StateDB.Commit -> conflict check -> native cache flush -> account deletion/balance burn`.
- Invariant to test: journaled reverts must roll back native bank writes and EVM dirty state together.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: run a local integration test that submits the crafted raw tx through JSON-RPC and compares committed state with direct keeper queries.
