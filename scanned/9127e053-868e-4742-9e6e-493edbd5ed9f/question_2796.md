# Q2796: roots_to_flush zero-lamport resurrection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `roots_to_flush` by submit transactions that keep many roots dirty while reading hot accounts with heavy write churn across nearby roots plus immediate reads so that dead or zero-lamport accounts can survive or reappear because cleanup and load paths disagree, breaking the invariant that closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_cache.rs::roots_to_flush
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that keep many roots dirty while reading hot accounts
- Attacker controls: heavy write churn across nearby roots plus immediate reads
- Exploit idea: look for stale dead-account visibility after close/recreate churn
- Invariant to test: closed accounts must not resurrect without a valid recreation path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: close and recreate the same attacker-controlled account shape repeatedly
