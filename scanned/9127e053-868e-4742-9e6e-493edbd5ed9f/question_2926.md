# Q2926: notify_slot root-flush visibility gap

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_slot` by trigger slot-related subscriptions and then drive hot transaction flow with slow consumer behavior and high-frequency slot events so that root advancement and flush state can diverge long enough for readers to observe impossible account histories, breaking the invariant that root visibility and flushed persistence must not diverge in externally observable ways and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_slot
- Entrypoint: trigger slot-related subscriptions and then drive hot transaction flow
- Attacker controls: slow consumer behavior and high-frequency slot events
- Exploit idea: search for split-brain visibility between rooted and flushed state
- Invariant to test: root visibility and flushed persistence must not diverge in externally observable ways
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: read the same pubkey during root movement and compare rooted versus cached answers
