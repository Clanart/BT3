# Q5407: status via borrow: apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to boun

## Question
`status` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115) derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, use that to apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output, violating the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115` -> `status`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `status` derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed. Reach it through `borrow` and apply a transform after the gate that was supposed to bound its output.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, then read `status` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
