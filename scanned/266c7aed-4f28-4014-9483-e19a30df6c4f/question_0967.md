# Q0967: scale-debt-for-liquidation via liquidate-multi: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
`scale-debt-for-liquidation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858) re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, use that to produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude, violating the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858` -> `scale-debt-for-liquidation`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `scale-debt-for-liquidation` re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, then read `scale-debt-for-liquidation` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
