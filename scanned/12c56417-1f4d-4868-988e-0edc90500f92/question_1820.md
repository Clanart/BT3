# Q1820: modify_memory_region_of_account reserved-key bypass

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `modify_memory_region_of_account` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with account layouts, duplicate writable aliases, realloc paths, and nested cpi writes such that duplicated accounts or versioned message features let attacker-controlled keys slip past reserved-key assumptions, breaking the invariant that reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/serialization.rs::modify_memory_region_of_account
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: account layouts, duplicate writable aliases, realloc paths, and nested CPI writes
- Exploit idea: search for paths where reserved-key checks see a different key set than execution
- Invariant to test: reserved-key protections must apply to the exact executed account set
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: construct versioned transactions whose ALT-expanded account set changes the effective key view
