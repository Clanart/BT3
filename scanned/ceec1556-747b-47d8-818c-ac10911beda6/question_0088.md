# Q0088: interpolate-rate via accrue: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block reach `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it interpolates between packed u16 curve points, the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `accrue` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
