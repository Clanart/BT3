# Q3030: check-confidence via call-ststx-ratio: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, can an unprivileged attacker make `check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent, so the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `check-confidence` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
