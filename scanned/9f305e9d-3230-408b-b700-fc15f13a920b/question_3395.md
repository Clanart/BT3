# Q3395: total-supply-preview via accrue: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Can an unprivileged caller of `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), by choosing the utilization the rate is interpolated at, use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `accrue` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
