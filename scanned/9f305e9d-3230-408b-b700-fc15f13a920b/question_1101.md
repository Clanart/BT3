# Q1101: ubalance via liquidate-redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `ubalance` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303) — which reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var — to attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position, breaking the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303` -> `ubalance`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `ubalance` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
