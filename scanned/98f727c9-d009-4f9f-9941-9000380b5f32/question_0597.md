# Q597: Misbind trusted context inside create_emergency_stop_txhandler

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `create_emergency_stop_txhandler` through public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline and make attacker-controlled the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering bind to the wrong trusted context, so the verifier nonce session that a final signature is supposed to consume is interpreted for one bridge action while authorizing another, violating the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/builder/transaction/mod.rs::create_emergency_stop_txhandler
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering
- Exploit idea: bind attacker-controlled the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering to the wrong trusted bridge context
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
