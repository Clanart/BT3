# Q2612: Duplicate queue or processing state in new_with_wt_tx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker cause the same user-reachable action to reach `new_with_wt_tx` twice with attacker-controlled the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof but different surrounding state, so only one layer deduplicates it, corrupting the SPV inclusion result for the payout transaction and violating the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: bridge-circuit-host/src/structs.rs::new_with_wt_tx
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Exploit idea: cause one action to be processed twice with different surrounding state via the method-id, network, and genesis-context assumptions implied by the incoming proof
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
