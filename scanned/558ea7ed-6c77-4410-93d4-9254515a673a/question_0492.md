# Q0492: ArbWomUp3.incentiveDeposit - the caller sets the conversion ratio for the protocol's own routing

## Question
Note that in wombat/ArbWomUp3.sol, _deposit() mode 2 forwards the caller's _convertRatio into IConverter(smartWomConvert).convert(toSwap, _convertRatio, 0, 0), so the caller decides how much of the deposit is routed through the AMM. Can an attacker holding only tokens bought on market reach it via `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _convertRatio, bool _bullMode, uint256 _mode)` under the caller sets _mode to 2 so the doubling applies and force `_convertRatio supplied by the caller` apart from `the buyback leg inside SmartWomConvert`, breaking the invariant that a routing parameter that decides how much value is traded must not be caller-supplied on a shared-balance path for Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/ArbWomUp3.sol -> `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _convertRatio, bool _bullMode, uint256 _mode)` (mechanism: the caller sets the conversion ratio for the protocol's own routing)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _convertRatio, bool _bullMode, uint256 _mode)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _amount, _convertRatio, _bullMode and _mode, with _mode selecting stake, mWomSV lock or plain transfer
- Exploit idea: _deposit() mode 2 forwards the caller's _convertRatio into IConverter(smartWomConvert).convert(toSwap, _convertRatio, 0, 0), so the caller decides how much of the deposit is routed through the AMM. Precondition: the caller sets _mode to 2 so the doubling applies.
- Invariant to test: a routing parameter that decides how much value is traded must not be caller-supplied on a shared-balance path; concretely, `_convertRatio supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the buyback leg inside SmartWomConvert`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish the caller sets _mode to 2 so the doubling applies, have the attacker run `incentiveDeposit(uint256 _amount, uint256 _convertRatio, bool _bullMode, uint256 _mode)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `_convertRatio supplied by the caller` versus `the buyback leg inside SmartWomConvert` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
