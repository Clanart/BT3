# Q2067: WombatPoolHelperV2.depositLP - receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary

## Question
wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol - _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Can an unprivileged attacker controlling _lpAmount, under the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, exploit this through `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` to break the reconciliation between `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` and `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` and the invariant that the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution, yielding Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelperV2.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: receipt-token delta credited to an attacker-chosen beneficiary)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount
- Exploit idea: _deposit() measures afterDeposit - beforeDeposit on the helper's own stakingToken balance and stakes that delta for _for, while WombatStaking mints the receipt token to msg.sender, so the amount minted and the account credited are decided in two separate places. Precondition: the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction.
- Invariant to test: the receipt tokens minted for a deposit and the MasterMagpie credit for that deposit must be one atomic attribution; concretely, `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` must stay reconciled with `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the caller sets _minimumLiquidity to zero and sandwiches the Wombat pool in the same transaction, then assert `_minimumLiquidity supplied by the caller` and `the LP actually minted by the Wombat pool` end identical in both runs.
