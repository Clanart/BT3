# Q3937: mask-to-list-internal via repay: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), drive `mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) — which expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries — to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, breaking the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `repay` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), then read `mask-to-list-internal` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
