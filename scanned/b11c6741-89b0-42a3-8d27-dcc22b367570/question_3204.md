# Q3204: get_lamports confuses account types or owners (instruction_accounts.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `get_lamports` in `transaction-context/src/instruction_accounts.rs` with an account whose data length changes between the check and the use, and have `get_lamports` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`get_lamports` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-context/src/instruction_accounts.rs` -> `get_lamports()` (around line 115)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: an account whose data length changes between the check and the use
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `get_lamports` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `get_lamports` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `get_lamports` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can deploy a program that reads or writes host/guest memory outside its permitted regions, or forges an account reference, and extracts or corrupts state belonging to other accounts.
