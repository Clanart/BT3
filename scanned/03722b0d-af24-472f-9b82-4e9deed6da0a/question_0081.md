# Q81: Replay context into handle_kickoff

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with attacker-controlled the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering so `handle_kickoff` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the verifier nonce session that a final signature is supposed to consume to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/verifier.rs::handle_kickoff
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
