# Q310: Accept wrong proof/network context in insert_reveal_try_to_send

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes through user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync so `insert_reveal_try_to_send` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the storage slot/value pair used to prove deposit or withdrawal state and breaking the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/sync.rs::insert_reveal_try_to_send
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for light-client proof blobs and their claimed heights / block hashes
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Bitcoin-anchoring verification failure: accepting a batch/commitment/proof that should not be accepted
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
