# Q1628: calc-utilization via collateral-remove-redeem: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) reach `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets, the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) varied, and assert that the value `calc-utilization` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
