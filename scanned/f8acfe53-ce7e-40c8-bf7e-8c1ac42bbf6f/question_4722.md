# Q4722: get-full-position via collateral-add: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap, so the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `collateral-add` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position's existing collateral and debt composition across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `get-full-position` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
