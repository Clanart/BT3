# Q3369: current_shopify_session: A JWT whose `exp` is in the past when `check_session_expiry_dat...

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker (the `id_token` URL param, the Authorization: Bearer header, `shop`, `host`, `session`, and the encrypted session cookie value) reach `current_shopify_session / load_current_session` in lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb via GET any EnsureHasSession-protected controller action (legacy auth strategy), supplying a JWT whose `exp` is in the past when `check_session_expiry_date` is false so `activate_shopify_session` skips expiry, so that session/shop conflict detection must force re-login whenever params disagree with the loaded session is violated, leading to cross-user session confusion (acting as another user)? Specifically confirm that the malicious input stays rejected across refactors (pinned fixture).

## Target
- File/function: lib/shopify_app/controller_concerns/login_protection.rb — `current_shopify_session / load_current_session`
- Entrypoint: GET any EnsureHasSession-protected controller action (legacy auth strategy)
- Attacker controls: the `id_token` URL param, the Authorization: Bearer header, `shop`, `host`, `session`, and the encrypted session cookie value — specifically a JWT whose `exp` is in the past when `check_session_expiry_date` is false so `activate_shopify_session` skips expiry.
- Exploit idea: Encode the exact malicious input as a fixture so a future refactor can't silently reopen the hole.
- Invariant to test: session/shop conflict detection must force re-login whenever params disagree with the loaded session
- Expected Immunefi impact: cross-user session confusion (acting as another user) (Shopify HackerOne in-scope; attacker is unprivileged, no leaked keys/DoS/social-engineering).
- Fast validation: regression fixture pinning the malicious input to a rejected outcome for CI.
