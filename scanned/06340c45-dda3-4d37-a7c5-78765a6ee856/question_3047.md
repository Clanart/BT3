# Q3047: Corrupt work or canonical ordering in get_chain_state_from_height

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker shape Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents so `get_chain_state_from_height` computes or compares work / ordering incorrectly, causing the wrong canonical chain or watchtower result to win, corrupting the storage-proof key/value binding used for deposit or withdrawal validation and violating the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/header_chain_prover.rs::get_chain_state_from_height
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Exploit idea: make the wrong chain or watchtower result win by shaping Bitcoin transaction shape, witness bytes, annexes, and OP_RETURN contents
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
