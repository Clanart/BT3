# Q3464: calc-multiplier-delta via redeem: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-out` reach `calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) in a state where it make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? Given that it compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag, the invariant that a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `redeem` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: a resolved price passed the confidence and staleness gates in the form the gates were designed for, after every transform
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with `min-out` varied, and assert that the value `calc-multiplier-delta` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
