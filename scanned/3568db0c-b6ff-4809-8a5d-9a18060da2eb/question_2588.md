# Q2588: interpolate-rate via collateral-remove-redeem: attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem reach `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) in a state where it attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position? Given that it interpolates between packed u16 curve points, the invariant that a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and attach a price resolved for one asset to a different asset in the position.
- Invariant to test: a position that holds value can always be priced, and therefore always closed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem varied, and assert that the value `interpolate-rate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
