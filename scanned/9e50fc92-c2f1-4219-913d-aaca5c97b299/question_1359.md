# Q1359: load_program loaded-data undercount

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `load_program` by submit transactions invoking deployed programs with program deployment/upgrade timing, cpi invocation patterns, and versioned message layouts such that loaded-accounts-data accounting can be made smaller than the real memory footprint or persisted delta, breaking the invariant that loaded account data size must track real loaded and committed state accurately and leading to `Liveness / Loss of Availability`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::load_program
- Entrypoint: submit transactions invoking deployed programs
- Attacker controls: program deployment/upgrade timing, CPI invocation patterns, and versioned message layouts
- Exploit idea: aim for account-resize and ALT-heavy transactions that undercount loaded state
- Invariant to test: loaded account data size must track real loaded and committed state accurately
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability
- Fast validation: compare loaded-accounts-data counters to actual touched and resized account bytes
