# Q433: Replay context into fetch_next_bitcoin_syncer_evt

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with attacker-controlled the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering so `fetch_next_bitcoin_syncer_evt` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the reimbursement path that must remain slashable and recoverable to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/database/bitcoin_syncer.rs::fetch_next_bitcoin_syncer_evt
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: each deposit context must map to exactly one verifier session, one signer set, and one move/emergency-stop bundle
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
