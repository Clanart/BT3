# Q2292: retry_durable_nonce_transactions serialization aliasing

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `retry_durable_nonce_transactions` by use json-rpc `sendtransaction` from one low-rate client with durable nonce transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and queue pressure such that account memory serialization or deserialization can alias overlapping regions and write back inconsistent data, breaking the invariant that one logical account backing store must not be interpreted as two independent writable regions and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: send-transaction-service/src/send_transaction_service.rs::retry_durable_nonce_transactions
- Entrypoint: use JSON-RPC `sendTransaction` from one low-rate client
- Attacker controls: durable nonce transactions, retry hints, blockhash freshness, and queue pressure
- Exploit idea: target duplicate accounts, reallocs, and nested CPIs that touch the same backing data twice
- Invariant to test: one logical account backing store must not be interpreted as two independent writable regions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace serialized and deserialized memory regions for duplicated writable accounts
