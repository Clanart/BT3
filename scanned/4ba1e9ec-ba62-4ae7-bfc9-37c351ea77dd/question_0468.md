# Q468: StateDB.AddBalance - Bank Credit Commits Through Native Cache After Evm Revert

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker execute a contract that moves EVM-denom value through nested calls through `EVM balance credit from CALL, SELFDESTRUCT, reward, or refund` while controlling `revert depth` and `account deletion timing`, under the precondition that the target account is created and destroyed in the same transaction, drive `StateDB balance operation -> ExecuteNativeAction -> journal append -> Commit` in `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.AddBalance` so that bank credit commits through native cache after EVM revert, violating the invariant that bank balances and EVM StateDB balances must remain one-to-one for the EVM denom, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `x/evm/statedb/statedb.go::StateDB.AddBalance`
- Entrypoint: `EVM balance credit from CALL, SELFDESTRUCT, reward, or refund`
- Attacker controls: `revert depth`, `account deletion timing`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: bank credit commits through native cache after EVM revert through `StateDB balance operation -> ExecuteNativeAction -> journal append -> Commit`.
- Invariant to test: bank balances and EVM StateDB balances must remain one-to-one for the EVM denom.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: write a focused Go unit test around the target function and assert bank supply, sender balance, nonce, code hash, logs, and receipt status before and after.
