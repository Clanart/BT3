# Q1062: process_transaction serialization aliasing

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `process_transaction` by submit transactions via `sendtransaction` or direct tpu quic with instruction order, duplicated accounts, nonce/blockhash choices, and fee / compute settings such that account memory serialization or deserialization can alias overlapping regions and write back inconsistent data, breaking the invariant that one logical account backing store must not be interpreted as two independent writable regions and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: runtime/src/bank.rs::process_transaction
- Entrypoint: submit transactions via `sendTransaction` or direct TPU QUIC
- Attacker controls: instruction order, duplicated accounts, nonce/blockhash choices, and fee / compute settings
- Exploit idea: target duplicate accounts, reallocs, and nested CPIs that touch the same backing data twice
- Invariant to test: one logical account backing store must not be interpreted as two independent writable regions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: trace serialized and deserialized memory regions for duplicated writable accounts
