# Q0858: write-feed via collateral-add: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling call ordering within the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `write-feed` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129) make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized? `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:129` -> `write-feed`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `write-feed` applies one Pyth price-feed update and folds its status. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz call ordering within the block across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `write-feed` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
