# Q3807: increment via collateral-remove-redeem: make a required price path abort so the position can no lo

## Question
`increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) advances the user-id nonce. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, use that to make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make a required price path abort so the position can no longer be closed or seized.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `increment` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
