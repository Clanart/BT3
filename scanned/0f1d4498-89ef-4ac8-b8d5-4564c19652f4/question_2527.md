# Q2527: process_message charges far less than it costs (consume_worker.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `process_message` in `core/src/banking_stage/consume_worker.rs` with arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied, and make the real CPU/memory cost of `process_message` exceed the units charged for it, so that the invariant "Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/banking_stage/consume_worker.rs` -> `process_message()` (around line 340)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied
- Exploit idea: Find the input shape where `process_message`'s real CPU/memory/IO cost grows much faster than the compute units or fee charged for it.
- Invariant to test: Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Measure real time/allocations versus units charged across input sizes; assert cost/CU ratio stays bounded.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can perform syscall, CPI, memory-mapping, or deserialization work whose real CPU/memory cost far exceeds the compute units charged, degrading nodes below true cost.
