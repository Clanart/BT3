# Q1037: EthSignerExtractionAdapter.GetSigners - Extension Option Ordering Bypasses Ethereum Signer Extraction

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit, replace, reorder, or batch pending transactions through `mempool signer extraction for Ethereum extension-option txs` while controlling `pending nonce` and `signer extraction`, under the precondition that strict nonce ordering is enforced by CometBFT mempool, drive `broadcastTx fallback -> CometBFT BroadcastTx -> FinalizeBlock ante` in `evmd/signer.go::EthSignerExtractionAdapter.GetSigners` so that extension-option ordering bypasses Ethereum signer extraction, violating the invariant that mempool ordering and signer extraction must match consensus validity, and causing a realistic Cronos critical impact by enabling unauthorized EVM-denom movement, fee/refund misaccounting, or account code/nonce mutation that leads to direct user-fund loss?

## Target
- File/function: `evmd/signer.go::EthSignerExtractionAdapter.GetSigners`
- Entrypoint: `mempool signer extraction for Ethereum extension-option txs`
- Attacker controls: `pending nonce`, `signer extraction`; public inputs only, no privileged roles, leaked keys, governance/admin actions, docs/tests/mocks/scripts, or disabled configs.
- Exploit idea: extension-option ordering bypasses Ethereum signer extraction through `broadcastTx fallback -> CometBFT BroadcastTx -> FinalizeBlock ante`.
- Invariant to test: mempool ordering and signer extraction must match consensus validity.
- Expected Immunefi impact: HackenProof Cronos Critical - direct unintentional withdrawal, draining, or loss of user funds on the in-scope Ethermint/Cronos blockchain target.
- Fast validation: write a focused Go unit test around the target function and assert bank supply, sender balance, nonce, code hash, logs, and receipt status before and after.
