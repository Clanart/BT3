# Q344: Desync metadata inside bump_fees_of_unconfirmed_fee_payer_txs

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit the `signed_tx_hex` payload through public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction so `bump_fees_of_unconfirmed_fee_payer_txs` stores or uses metadata that describes a different intent than the raw transaction/proof it later sends, corrupting the cancel/activate dependency graph persisted in the database and violating the invariant that database state must not say a send path is finalized / active when the raw transaction path says otherwise, leading to Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/cpfp.rs::bump_fees_of_unconfirmed_fee_payer_txs
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Exploit idea: make raw bytes and persisted metadata describe different intents using the `signed_tx_hex` payload
- Invariant to test: database state must not say a send path is finalized / active when the raw transaction path says otherwise
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
