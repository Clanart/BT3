# Q204: Accept wrong proof/network context in fetch_block_info_from_height

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values through broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation so `fetch_block_info_from_height` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the watchtower ordering / max-total-work decision used to judge operator honesty and breaking the invariant that canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/bitcoin_syncer.rs::fetch_block_info_from_height
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for the header sequence, timestamps, and `bits` values
- Invariant to test: canonical-chain tracking must never let a non-canonical header/tx/proof outrank the intended Bitcoin view
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
