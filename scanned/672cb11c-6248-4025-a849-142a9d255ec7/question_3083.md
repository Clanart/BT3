# Q3083: notify_watchers read-only cache incoherence

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_watchers` by trigger many hot notifications from one subscription shape with subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams so that read-only caching can return a version that writable/runtime paths would reject as stale, breaking the invariant that read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state and leading to `Consensus/Safety Violations`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_watchers
- Entrypoint: trigger many hot notifications from one subscription shape
- Attacker controls: subscription mix, slow consumer behavior, and hot event streams
- Exploit idea: diff read-only and runtime-visible answers for the same account
- Invariant to test: read-only caches must stay coherent with runtime-visible state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violations
- Fast validation: compare read-only cache results to direct runtime/bank reads after writes
