# Q1244: EVM Wormhole deployTokenExtension malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public deploy flow through `deployToken` on Wormhole-backed chains` with boundary-controlled inputs covering nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and make `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::deployTokenExtension` violate `message publication must stay synchronized with on-chain deployment state so a failed or reordered publish cannot leave a live token with no corresponding remote registration or vice versa` in the `malicious metadata manufactures a bridge identity` attack class because serializes a Wormhole `DeployToken` payload and publishes it with the current nonce before incrementing `wormholeNonce` becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridgeWormhole.sol::deployTokenExtension`
- Entrypoint: `public deploy flow through `deployToken` on Wormhole-backed chains`
- Attacker controls: msg.value, current `wormholeNonce`, token string, deployed token address, decimals, and origin decimals
- Exploit idea: Exploit arbitrary token metadata calls, old/new ABI switching, or malformed strings in metadata proofs. Concentrate on nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters.
- Invariant to test: message publication must stay synchronized with on-chain deployment state so a failed or reordered publish cannot leave a live token with no corresponding remote registration or vice versa
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Publish or prove pathological metadata values and assert that downstream deployment and mapping logic still binds to the right remote asset and decimals. Sweep boundary values for nonce boundaries, bucket boundaries, and maximal counters and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
