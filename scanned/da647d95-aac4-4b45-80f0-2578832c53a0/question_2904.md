# Q2904: NEAR finish_withdraw_v2 legacy or migration path aliasing through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `legacy/public withdrawal completion path on migrated tokens` with control over sender id, bridged token contract calling in, amount, and recipient string parsed as Ethereum address and desynchronize `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::finish_withdraw_v2` from the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `legacy or migration path aliasing` attack class because accepts calls only from deployed-token contracts, allocates new origin and destination nonces, stores an outbound transfer, and logs an `InitTransfer` event to Ethereum, violating `legacy withdrawal completion must not let unprivileged callers mint outbound bridge claims without a corresponding inbound burn or with a misbound recipient`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::finish_withdraw_v2`
- Entrypoint: `legacy/public withdrawal completion path on migrated tokens`
- Attacker controls: sender id, bridged token contract calling in, amount, and recipient string parsed as Ethereum address
- Exploit idea: Use memo-triggered legacy paths, migrated-token aliases, or old/new token relationships to create a second valid outbound interpretation of the same balance change. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping.
- Invariant to test: legacy withdrawal completion must not let unprivileged callers mint outbound bridge claims without a corresponding inbound burn or with a misbound recipient
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Exercise both the modern and legacy branches with equivalent economic inputs and assert that only one bridge claim can arise from one unit of consumed value. Also assert cross-module consistency between `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::finish_withdraw_v2` and the adjacent replay-protection bookkeeping after every branch.
