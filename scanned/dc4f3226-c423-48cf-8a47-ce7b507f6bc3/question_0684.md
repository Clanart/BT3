# Q0684: BaseRewardPool.getReward - rewardTokens array grows without bound and without removal

## Question
In rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol, queueNewRewards() and _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer() push into rewardTokens with no way to remove an entry, and getReward()/updateFor() iterate the whole array, so a token that starts reverting on transfer makes the claim-all path revert for every staker forever. Can an unprivileged attacker reach this through `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` while the pool has exactly one registered reward token and no queued backlog, and drive `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` out of agreement with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))` - breaking the invariant that one misbehaving reward token must not be able to block settlement of the remaining reward tokens - for High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol -> `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` (mechanism: rewardTokens array grows without bound and without removal)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the timing of the claim, reachable through MasterMagpie.multiclaim
- Exploit idea: queueNewRewards() and _queueNewRewardsWithoutTransfer() push into rewardTokens with no way to remove an entry, and getReward()/updateFor() iterate the whole array, so a token that starts reverting on transfer makes the claim-all path revert for every staker forever. Precondition: the pool has exactly one registered reward token and no queued backlog.
- Invariant to test: one misbehaving reward token must not be able to block settlement of the remaining reward tokens; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` must stay reconciled with `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Foundry fork test against the deployed pool: set up the pool has exactly one registered reward token and no queued backlog, snapshot `rewards[_rewardToken].historicalRewards` and `IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this))`, run the attacker's `getReward(address _account, address _receiver)` sequence, then assert the two still reconcile and the attacker's net token balance did not increase.
