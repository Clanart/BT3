# Q2057: BaseRewardPool.updateFor - _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles

## Question
rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol: _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. With the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted under attacker control and the staking token is an 18-decimal Wombat receipt token and totalStaked() is far above 1e18, can an unprivileged caller sequence `updateFor(address _account)` so that `rewards[_rewardToken].queuedRewards` and `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` no longer reconcile, violating the invariant that a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered and realising High - Theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: rewards/BaseRewardPool.sol -> `updateFor(address _account)` (mechanism: _sendReward zeroes userRewards before the transfer settles)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `updateFor(address _account)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: the victim address and the exact block in which their reward index is snapshotted
- Exploit idea: _sendReward() writes userRewards[token][account] = 0 and then calls safeTransfer, so a reward token that consumes less than the full amount, reverts silently, or re-enters leaves the accounting cleared with the value not delivered. Precondition: the staking token is an 18-decimal Wombat receipt token and totalStaked() is far above 1e18.
- Invariant to test: a reward entitlement may only be cleared once the exact amount has been irrevocably delivered; concretely, `rewards[_rewardToken].queuedRewards` must stay reconciled with `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the staking token is an 18-decimal Wombat receipt token and totalStaked() is far above 1e18, then assert `rewards[_rewardToken].queuedRewards` and `rewards[_rewardToken].rewardPerTokenStored` end identical in both runs.
