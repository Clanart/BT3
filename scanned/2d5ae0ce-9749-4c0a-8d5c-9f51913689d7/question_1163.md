# Q1163: EVM init/finalize optional message semantics resume-path replay or duplication through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public `initTransfer`, `initTransfer1155`, and `finTransfer`` with control over empty versus non-empty message bytes and recipient contracts that react differently to message-carrying mints and desynchronize `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol optional `message` handling` from the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `resume-path replay or duplication` attack class because uses message presence to choose between plain mint and message-based mint on bridge tokens and to include or omit Borsh-encoded message bytes in signatures, violating `optional message semantics must not let an attacker switch the economic branch after the source event is fixed, thereby changing whether callbacks can refund or consume tokens`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol optional `message` handling`
- Entrypoint: `public `initTransfer`, `initTransfer1155`, and `finTransfer``
- Attacker controls: empty versus non-empty message bytes and recipient contracts that react differently to message-carrying mints
- Exploit idea: Abuse yield/resume or asynchronous callback timing so the same pending outbound transfer is restarted after it already progressed. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting.
- Invariant to test: optional message semantics must not let an attacker switch the economic branch after the source event is fixed, thereby changing whether callbacks can refund or consume tokens
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trigger timeouts, duplicate funding, and repeated callback delivery and assert that the resumed transfer either progresses once or cleanly fails once. Also assert cross-module consistency between `evm/src/omni-bridge/contracts/OmniBridge.sol optional `message` handling` and the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting after every branch.
