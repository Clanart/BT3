# Q2511: create_account notification filter overload

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `create_account` by submit transactions that rapidly create, fund, close, and recreate accounts with rapid create-close-recreate cycles and near-boundary account sizes so that attacker-chosen notification filters force more post-filter work than the subscriber semantics imply, breaking the invariant that notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::create_account
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that rapidly create, fund, close, and recreate accounts
- Attacker controls: rapid create-close-recreate cycles and near-boundary account sizes
- Exploit idea: use valid subscription filters as the amplifier
- Invariant to test: notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: compare pre-filter candidate counts to delivered-notification counts
