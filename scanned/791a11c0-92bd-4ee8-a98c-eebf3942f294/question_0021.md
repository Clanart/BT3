# Q21: Tier Update Replay Across Mixed Context

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through `HandlerV2.handlePostRequests(IHost host, request) -> BandwidthManager.onAccept` with attacker-controlled purchase parameters, app and chain bytes, authenticated inbound purchase or governance messages, and fee-token decimals and mixing bytes that were valid in one proof, chain, module, order, or beneficiary context with metadata interpreted in another context, and make `onAccept` apply the same tier or credit update more than once through replay, duplicate batching, or shared state reuse so `the one-time application state for a tier or credit update` becomes inconsistent with `one authenticated application of the same update`, breaking the invariant that tier updates and purchase credits must not be replayable once one authenticated application has committed and leading to High: duplicate settlement, duplicate claim, or double execution of a one-time flow?

## Target
- File/function: evm/src/apps/BandwidthManager.sol::onAccept
- Entrypoint: HandlerV2.handlePostRequests(IHost host, request) -> BandwidthManager.onAccept
- Attacker controls: purchase parameters, app and chain bytes, authenticated inbound purchase or governance messages, and fee-token decimals
- Exploit idea: Apply the same tier or credit update more than once through replay, duplicate batching, or shared state reuse. Try a pair of otherwise valid artifacts where one verification step authenticates the old context and a later step consumes the new context.
- Invariant to test: tier updates and purchase credits must not be replayable once one authenticated application has committed
- Expected Immunefi impact: High: duplicate settlement, duplicate claim, or double execution of a one-time flow.
- Fast validation: Apply one authenticated update or credit first, then replay the same material and assert prices, credits, and events do not double-apply. Build two neighboring valid contexts and mutate only the binding field while asserting state, receipts, and balances stay unchanged.
