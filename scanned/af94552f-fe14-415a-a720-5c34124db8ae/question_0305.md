# Q305: Accept wrong proof/network context in max_chunk_reveal_transaction_stays_under_standard_weight

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker supply the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges through user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync so `max_chunk_reveal_transaction_stays_under_standard_weight` accepts it without fully binding network, method-id, genesis, or height context, corrupting the light-client proof context tied to a specific Bitcoin block and breaking the invariant that Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/citrea/reveal_scripts.rs::max_chunk_reveal_transaction_stays_under_standard_weight
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges
- Exploit idea: omit full network, method-id, genesis, or height binding for the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges
- Invariant to test: Citrea proofs and logs must bind exactly one L1 block, one L2 state root, and one bridge state transition
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
