# Q3166: filter_signature_result result-cloning chain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `filter_signature_result` by use in-scope signature subscriptions and many status changes with signature subscription parameters and hot status churn so that large notification objects are cloned more than necessary, breaking the invariant that notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::filter_signature_result
- Entrypoint: use in-scope signature subscriptions and many status changes
- Attacker controls: signature subscription parameters and hot status churn
- Exploit idea: look for repeated clones of the same large object
- Invariant to test: notification emission should avoid redundant cloning of large payloads
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: profile allocations and clone counts while delivering large notifications
