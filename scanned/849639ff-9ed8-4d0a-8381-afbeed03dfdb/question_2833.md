# Q2833: Solana finalize_transfer nonce bitmap storage quote underestimates live state via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public inbound Solana flow through `finalize_transfer` and `finalize_transfer_sol`` and then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint so that `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs plus finalize instruction` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `storage quote underestimates live state` under buckets destination nonces into multiple PDAs and compensates rent as the highest observed nonce advances, violating `cross-PDA nonce accounting must not let a replay land in an uninitialized bucket or refund reserve lamports while keeping the nonce marked unused`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/state/used_nonces.rs plus finalize instruction`
- Entrypoint: `public inbound Solana flow through `finalize_transfer` and `finalize_transfer_sol``
- Attacker controls: destination nonce, PDA bucket index, payer rent, and initialization order
- Exploit idea: Target helper functions that quote storage for pending transfers, finalization records, fast transfers, binds, or deployments. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: cross-PDA nonce accounting must not let a replay land in an uninitialized bucket or refund reserve lamports while keeping the nonce marked unused
- Expected Immunefi impact: Permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Measure storage usage across maximal inputs and assert that quoted requirements always exceed or equal the true post-state footprint. Then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
