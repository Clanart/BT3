# Q1284: NEAR per-chain token origin detection numeric cast or overflow changes economic meaning at boundary values

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger `public init/finalize/lock flows through token-origin checks` with boundary-controlled inputs covering empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and make `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::get_token_origin_chain` violate `origin-chain inference must never let an attacker make the bridge classify a token as native when it is wrapped, or vice versa, because that changes custody accounting` in the `numeric cast or overflow changes economic meaning` attack class because infers origin chain from deployment caches, UTXO config, or token-account naming conventions before deciding whether to lock/unlock liquidity becomes fragile at those edges?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::get_token_origin_chain`
- Entrypoint: `public init/finalize/lock flows through token-origin checks`
- Attacker controls: token account ids whose prefixes influence inferred origin chain and whether the token is in deployed sets or UTXO configs
- Exploit idea: Focus on `u128`/`u64`/`usize` casts, PDA bucket indices, and amount conversions around maximum values. Concentrate on empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings.
- Invariant to test: origin-chain inference must never let an attacker make the bridge classify a token as native when it is wrapped, or vice versa, because that changes custody accounting
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Fuzz maximal numbers and assert that every accepted numeric value preserves its economic meaning across all intermediate representations. Sweep boundary values for empty strings, maximal lengths, and malformed encodings and assert that the same invariant holds at every edge.
