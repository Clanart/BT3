# Q279: NEAR EVM eNear interface path native versus wrapped branch switch via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `legacy/public eNEAR mint/burn/finalize flows` and then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint so that `evm/src/eNear/contracts/IENear.sol and ENearProxy usage` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `native versus wrapped branch switch` under legacy proxy routes proof-validated Near outcomes into an older eNEAR mint/burn interface that still interacts with live bridge state, violating `legacy adapter flows must not let stale eNEAR semantics bypass current replay protection or asset-backing assumptions`?

## Target
- File/function: `evm/src/eNear/contracts/IENear.sol and ENearProxy usage`
- Entrypoint: `legacy/public eNEAR mint/burn/finalize flows`
- Attacker controls: proof bytes, receipt ids, token address, amount, and pause state
- Exploit idea: Target zero-address, deployed-token, custom-minter, native-vault, or bridge-token branch predicates. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: legacy adapter flows must not let stale eNEAR semantics bypass current replay protection or asset-backing assumptions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Force each branch predicate to flip around callbacks or mapping writes and assert that the same source asset can never produce two incompatible custody models. Then replay or reorder another proof-consuming public entrypoint and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
