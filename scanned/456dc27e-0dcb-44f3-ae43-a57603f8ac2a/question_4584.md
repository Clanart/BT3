# Q4584: add-user-scaled-debt via liquidate: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `collateral-receiver` reach `add-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237) in a state where it produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? Given that it adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default, the invariant that each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237` -> `add-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: each callcode preserves magnitude and sign and cannot be moved by the caller in the same transaction
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `collateral-receiver` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `add-user-scaled-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
