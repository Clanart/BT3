# Q3075: total-supply-preview via supply-collateral-add: judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different a

## Question
`total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, use that to judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set, violating the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and judge a position against an LTV belonging to a different asset set.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-supply-preview` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
