# Q1566: prepare_next_cpi_instruction nonce replay window

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `prepare_next_cpi_instruction` by submit transactions that perform cpi with instruction ordering, signer seeds, duplicated account metas, writable/read-only aliasing, and nested cpi depth such that durable nonce or recent-blockhash state can be observed one way here and a different way later in the same submission lifecycle, breaking the invariant that nonce and blockhash freshness checks must be stable across the full processing pipeline and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs::prepare_next_cpi_instruction
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that perform CPI
- Attacker controls: instruction ordering, signer seeds, duplicated account metas, writable/read-only aliasing, and nested CPI depth
- Exploit idea: find a same-slot or retry-driven way to reuse a nonce or stale blockhash window
- Invariant to test: nonce and blockhash freshness checks must be stable across the full processing pipeline
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: replay durable-nonce and edge-age blockhash transactions across retries and batches
