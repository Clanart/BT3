# Q2536: add_root_and_flush_write_cache notification filter overload

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `add_root_and_flush_write_cache` by submit transactions that write many accounts near root transitions with many-account write bursts plus immediate root/read churn so that attacker-chosen notification filters force more post-filter work than the subscriber semantics imply, breaking the invariant that notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set and leading to `RPC DoS/Crash`?

## Target
- File/function: accounts-db/src/accounts_db.rs::add_root_and_flush_write_cache
- Entrypoint: submit transactions that write many accounts near root transitions
- Attacker controls: many-account write bursts plus immediate root/read churn
- Exploit idea: use valid subscription filters as the amplifier
- Invariant to test: notification filtering must stay proportional to the subscribed event set
- Expected Immunefi impact: RPC DoS/Crash
- Fast validation: compare pre-filter candidate counts to delivered-notification counts
