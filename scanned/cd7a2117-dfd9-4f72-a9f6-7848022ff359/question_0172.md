# Q172: NEAR init_transfer resume path origin and destination nonce desynchronization via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `yield-resume callback for a previously deferred outbound transfer` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_resume` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `origin and destination nonce desynchronization` under removes a stored promise id, retries storage transfer from the message account, and then restarts `init_transfer_internal` after a timeout or callback result, violating `resume logic must never let one deferred transfer be funded, resumed, or emitted more than once or under a different payer/value pairing`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::init_transfer_resume`
- Entrypoint: `yield-resume callback for a previously deferred outbound transfer`
- Attacker controls: timing of storage funding, promise completion order, storage owner, message-storage account state, and the original transfer message contents
- Exploit idea: Drive retries, resume paths, or recursive bridge legs until one deposit appears under more than one transfer identity. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: resume logic must never let one deferred transfer be funded, resumed, or emitted more than once or under a different payer/value pairing
- Expected Immunefi impact: Cross-chain replay attacks enabling double-spending
- Fast validation: Trace every nonce mutation site and fuzz repeated calls plus reordered callbacks to prove that one deposit cannot create two valid transfer ids or destination messages. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
