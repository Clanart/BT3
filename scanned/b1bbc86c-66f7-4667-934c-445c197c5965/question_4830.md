# Q4830: WombatBribeManager.claimAllBribes - claimAllBribes only accounts the first bribe token per pool

## Question
In wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol, claimAllBribes() sets rewardTokens[i] = IWombatBribe(bribesContract).rewardTokens()[0] and reports earnedRewards for that token alone, while IBribeRewardPool.getReward transfers every registered reward token, so all tokens beyond index zero are moved without being reported. Starting from a state where delegatedPool is unset so the delegate legs are skipped, can an unprivileged EOA use `claimAllBribes(address _for)` to leave `userTotalVotedInVlmgp[msg.sender]` inconsistent with `IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(msg.sender)`, violating the invariant that the amounts reported by a claim must cover every token the claim actually moved and extracting High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatBribeManager.sol -> `claimAllBribes(address _for)` (mechanism: claimAllBribes only accounts the first bribe token per pool)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `claimAllBribes(address _for)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _for (any victim) and the block at which every pool rewarder is settled for them
- Exploit idea: claimAllBribes() sets rewardTokens[i] = IWombatBribe(bribesContract).rewardTokens()[0] and reports earnedRewards for that token alone, while IBribeRewardPool.getReward transfers every registered reward token, so all tokens beyond index zero are moved without being reported. Precondition: delegatedPool is unset so the delegate legs are skipped.
- Invariant to test: the amounts reported by a claim must cover every token the claim actually moved; concretely, `userTotalVotedInVlmgp[msg.sender]` must stay reconciled with `IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(msg.sender)`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Two-account fork test (victim and attacker): establish delegatedPool is unset so the delegate legs are skipped, have the attacker run `claimAllBribes(address _for)`, then assert the victim's claimable value and the `userTotalVotedInVlmgp[msg.sender]` versus `IVLMGP(vlMGP).getUserTotalLocked(msg.sender)` relation are unchanged by the attacker's transaction.
