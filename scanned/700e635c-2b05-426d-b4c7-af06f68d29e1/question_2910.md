# Q2910: notify_slot_update slot-removal liveness bug

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_slot_update` by trigger slot-related subscriptions and then drive hot transaction flow with slow consumer behavior and high-frequency slot events so that slot-removal logic can discard account data still needed by later state resolution, breaking the invariant that slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_slot_update
- Entrypoint: trigger slot-related subscriptions and then drive hot transaction flow
- Attacker controls: slow consumer behavior and high-frequency slot events
- Exploit idea: target old/new slot overlap for the same pubkey
- Invariant to test: slot-removal must preserve every still-reachable account version
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn one pubkey across removable and non-removable slots
