# Q2999: notify_roots cleanup drops live state

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `notify_roots` by subscribe to roots and then drive hot slot/root movement with root subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot root movement so that cleanup or compaction can discard still-live attacker-controlled account state, breaking the invariant that live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable and leading to `Loss of Funds`?

## Target
- File/function: rpc/src/rpc_subscriptions.rs::notify_roots
- Entrypoint: subscribe to roots and then drive hot slot/root movement
- Attacker controls: root subscriptions, slow consumer behavior, and hot root movement
- Exploit idea: look for mistaken liveness decisions under fast churn
- Invariant to test: live accounts must never be cleaned or compacted away while still reachable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds
- Fast validation: churn many attacker-owned accounts through close/recreate/update cycles
