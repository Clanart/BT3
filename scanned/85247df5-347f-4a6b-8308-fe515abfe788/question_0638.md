# Q0638: get-egroup via collateral-remove: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `get-egroup` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
