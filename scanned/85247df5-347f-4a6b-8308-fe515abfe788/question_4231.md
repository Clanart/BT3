# Q4231: system-repay via repay: satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was n

## Question
`system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902) splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept, violating the invariant that the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902` -> `system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Reach it through `repay` and satisfy the freshness gate with a timestamp the gate was never meant to accept.
- Invariant to test: the LTV a position is judged against belongs to the exact asset set it will hold after the call
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `system-repay` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
