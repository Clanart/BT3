# Q1158: Exploit ordering assumptions in start_bitcoin_syncer_new_block_mined

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use attacker-controlled reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height so `start_bitcoin_syncer_new_block_mined` validates the right inputs in the wrong order, corrupting the L1 block hash carried from the light-client proof into bridge validation and breaking the invariant that proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement, leading to Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/bitcoin_syncer.rs::start_bitcoin_syncer_new_block_mined
- Entrypoint: broadcast crafted Bitcoin transactions, headers, witnesses, or proofs that later reach sync, prover, or circuit validation
- Attacker controls: reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Exploit idea: validate the right pieces in the wrong order using reorg timing around the same txid / outpoint / block height
- Invariant to test: proof verification must bind method id, network, genesis context, proof inputs, and on-chain data to one canonical statement
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Invalid state transition accepted as valid (soundness bug in proving/verifying/transition logic) leading to direct loss of funds or protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: build a regtest/property test that mutates the relevant Bitcoin tx/header/proof field and assert sync/prover/circuit code rejects it without changing canonical bridge state
