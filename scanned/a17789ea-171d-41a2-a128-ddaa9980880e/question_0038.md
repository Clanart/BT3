# Q0038: is-healthy-with-mask via borrow: normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward? `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW, so the invariant that collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `borrow` and normalize a real holding to zero USD while the paired debt normalizes upward.
- Invariant to test: collateral is valued low and debt is valued high at every call site without exception
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `is-healthy-with-mask` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
