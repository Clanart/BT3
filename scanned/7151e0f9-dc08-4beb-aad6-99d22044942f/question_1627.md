# Q1627: NEAR wNEAR unwrap path mint-with-message path differs economically from plain mint via reordered second step

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker first create one valid bridge state through `public finalize and fast-transfer payouts when the token is `wnear_account_id` and `msg` is empty` and then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution so that `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens wNEAR branch` ends up accepting two inconsistent interpretations of the same economic event specifically around `mint-with-message path differs economically from plain mint` under unwraps wNEAR with one yocto deposit and then forwards raw NEAR to the recipient in a callback, violating `wNEAR unwrapping must not let attackers trigger a payout path that spends wrapped liquidity while leaving the associated transfer finalization unsettled or replayable`?

## Target
- File/function: `near/omni-bridge/src/lib.rs::send_tokens wNEAR branch`
- Entrypoint: `public finalize and fast-transfer payouts when the token is `wnear_account_id` and `msg` is empty`
- Attacker controls: token id chosen through mapping, recipient account, amount, and callback success/failure
- Exploit idea: Target bridge-token wrappers that mint to a temporary holder or rely on `ft_transfer_call`-style callbacks. Then chain it with a reordered or duplicated complementary bridge step.
- Invariant to test: wNEAR unwrapping must not let attackers trigger a payout path that spends wrapped liquidity while leaving the associated transfer finalization unsettled or replayable
- Expected Immunefi impact: Theft or permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Compare balances and state after every callback result and assert equivalence between message and no-message branches. Then replay or reorder later callback or refund resolution and assert that the bridge still exposes only one valid economic outcome.
