# Q3329: AnkrBNBPoolHelper.depositNative - no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper

## Question
In wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol, none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Does `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` let an unprivileged caller exploit that under a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, so that `pid cached at construction` diverges from `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, the invariant that the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard is broken, and the result is Critical - Direct theft of user funds?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/AnkrBNBPoolHelper.sol -> `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` (mechanism: no reentrancy guard anywhere on the helper)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: msg.value and _minimumLiquidity
- Exploit idea: none of deposit, depositLP, depositNative, withdraw or harvest carries nonReentrant, so the only protection is WombatStaking's own guard and any callback token on the deposit-token or receipt-token path re-enters the helper freely. Precondition: a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper.
- Invariant to test: the deposit and withdrawal helper must hold its own reentrancy domain rather than relying on a downstream guard; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: Single-transaction PoC contract executing the whole `depositNative(uint256 _minimumLiquidity)` sequence atomically under a residual stakingToken balance from an earlier rounding sits on the helper, asserting at the end that `pid cached at construction` still equals `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` and the PoC's balance delta is non-positive.
