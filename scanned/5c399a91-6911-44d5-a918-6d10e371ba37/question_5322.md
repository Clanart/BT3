# Q5322: add-user-scaled-debt via borrow: produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while bei

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the future mask produced by the new debt bit, can an unprivileged attacker make `add-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237) produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude? `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default, so the invariant that every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237` -> `add-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `borrow` and produce a price that passes `oracle-price-legal` while being wrong by orders of magnitude.
- Invariant to test: every price is attached to the asset it was resolved for, and each asset enters the totals exactly once
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the future mask produced by the new debt bit across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `add-user-scaled-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
