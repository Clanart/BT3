# Q5147: WombatPoolHelper.depositLP - deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path

## Question
In wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol, WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Starting from a state where the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, can an unprivileged EOA use `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` to leave `pid cached at construction` inconsistent with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`, violating the invariant that principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding and extracting High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours?

## Target
- File/function: wombat/WombatPoolHelper.sol -> `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)` (mechanism: deposit and withdraw both run the full harvest and fee path)
- Entrypoint: unprivileged EOA or attacker-deployed contract calling `depositLP(uint256 _lpAmount)`; no owner, poolManager, ankrOperator, rewardManager, compounder or ProxyAdmin role
- Attacker controls: _lpAmount and the LP tokens pulled from the caller
- Exploit idea: WombatStaking._toMasterWomAndSendReward is invoked on every deposit, depositLP and withdraw, so any revert inside the fee loop, the smart convert leg or a rewarder queue blocks principal movement for the whole pool. Precondition: the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling.
- Invariant to test: principal deposits and withdrawals must not depend on an external price or an optional reward leg succeeding; concretely, `pid cached at construction` must stay reconciled with `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking`.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 24 hours
- Fast validation: Differential test: perform the same economic action as one call and as several split calls under the attacker has moved the wom/mWom Wombat pool immediately before calling, then assert `pid cached at construction` and `pools[lpToken].pid in WombatStaking` end identical in both runs.
