# Q1090: Solana InitTransfer::process recipient or message ambiguity through cross-module drift

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `public outbound flow through `init_transfer`` with control over mint/vault branch choice, user signer, token account contents, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, and message and desynchronize `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/init_transfer.rs::process` from the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting that shares the same asset, nonce, proof subject, or mapping specifically in the `recipient or message ambiguity` attack class because routes an outbound transfer through native-vault custody or bridged-burn semantics and posts the serialized message to Wormhole/Near, violating `the posted payload must remain exactly backed by the consumed token or SOL value regardless of which branch executes`?

## Target
- File/function: `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/init_transfer.rs::process`
- Entrypoint: `public outbound flow through `init_transfer``
- Attacker controls: mint/vault branch choice, user signer, token account contents, amount, fee, native fee, recipient string, and message
- Exploit idea: Exploit non-canonical string, ByteArray, hex, or account-id forms to make one source-side intent resolve to a different destination-side recipient or message. Focus on drift between this module and the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting.
- Invariant to test: the posted payload must remain exactly backed by the consumed token or SOL value regardless of which branch executes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: Cross-check source-side serialization against every downstream parser and assert that equivalent-looking inputs cannot resolve to distinct destination accounts or app messages. Also assert cross-module consistency between `solana/programs/bridge_token_factory/src/instructions/user/init_transfer.rs::process` and the adjacent mint, burn, or custody accounting after every branch.
