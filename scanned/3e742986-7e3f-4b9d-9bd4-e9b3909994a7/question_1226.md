# Q1226: Replay context into get_storage_proof

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync with attacker-controlled the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges so `get_storage_proof` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the L1/L2 height pair treated as finalized and safe to bridge against to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action, leading to Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/citrea.rs::get_storage_proof
- Entrypoint: user-triggered Citrea deposit/withdraw activity or crafted Citrea proof/log data later consumed by background sync
- Attacker controls: the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed the timing of L1/L2 height selection around retries and finalization edges in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: replacement deposits must never let old move-tx linkage or stale LCP state authorize a new bridge action
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct theft of BTC/cBTC via deposit/withdraw verification bugs
- Fast validation: build a Rust test that mutates LCP/storage-proof height, root, and slot/value bindings and assert the bridge never accepts a wrong-context Citrea state
