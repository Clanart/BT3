# Q1840: Leave reusable partial state in on_ready_to_reimburse_entry

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker force a partial failure around the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering and then resume public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline so `on_ready_to_reimburse_entry` continues from stale intermediate state, causing the deposit-to-move-tx binding to diverge from the canonical bridge context and breaking the invariant that partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/states/round.rs::on_ready_to_reimburse_entry
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering
- Exploit idea: force a partial failure around the deposit transaction timing, block placement, and confirmation ordering and then resume under changed state
- Invariant to test: partial pipeline failures must not leave reusable or cross-bindable signing state behind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
