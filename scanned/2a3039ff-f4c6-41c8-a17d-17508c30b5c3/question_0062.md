# Q62: Replay context into create_burn_unused_kickoff_connectors_tx

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline with attacker-controlled the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering so `create_burn_unused_kickoff_connectors_tx` reuses a previously accepted context, causing the emergency-stop transaction that should protect the same deposit to be consumed twice and breaking the invariant that signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context, leading to Critical. Direct loss of funds?

## Target
- File/function: core/src/operator.rs::create_burn_unused_kickoff_connectors_tx
- Entrypoint: public gRPC `ClementineAggregator.NewDeposit` request and the resulting deposit presigning pipeline
- Attacker controls: the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering
- Exploit idea: reuse or replay previously consumed the streamed nonce-session identifiers and public nonce ordering in a fresh context
- Invariant to test: signatures gathered for one deposit must never authorize a different deposit, replacement, or round context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Direct loss of funds
- Fast validation: add a Rust integration test that runs the deposit pipeline twice with mutated attacker input and assert the move/emergency-stop signatures stay bound to one deposit context
