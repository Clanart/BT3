# Q3189: Parse a malformed object path in save_activated_txid

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker craft the `fee_paying_type` choice so `save_activated_txid` parses, hashes, or stores one object while later logic signs, verifies, or settles a meaningfully different one, corrupting the fee-payer UTXO chain selected for CPFP/RBF and violating the invariant that RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent, leading to Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator?

## Target
- File/function: crates/clementine-tx-sender/src/db/tx_sender.rs::save_activated_txid
- Entrypoint: public JSON-RPC `send_tx` request or a user-triggered automation path that enqueues a Bitcoin transaction
- Attacker controls: the `fee_paying_type` choice
- Exploit idea: parse, hash, or store one object while later logic settles another by crafting the `fee_paying_type` choice
- Invariant to test: RBF/CPFP logic must never add, reorder, or reuse UTXOs in a way that changes who pays or what gets spent
- Expected Immunefi impact: Medium. Griefing that causes large-scale disruption of deposits/withdrawals without theft other than by the Aggregator
- Fast validation: add a Rust test that enqueues conflicting raw tx / metadata / RBF / cancel / activate combinations and assert the DB and final spend path remain consistent
